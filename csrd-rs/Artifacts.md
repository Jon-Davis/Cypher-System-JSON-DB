ANGELIC WARD
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Tiny figurine of a winged angel
Effect: Once activated, the figurine's spirit emerges and becomes semisolid as a glowing, human-sized winged angel. It follows within 3 feet (1 m) of the figurine owner. Anything within long range that attacks the owner is attacked by the angelic ward, which sends out a bolt of flesh-rotting energy, doing damage equal to the artifact's level. Once activated, it functions for a day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

RING OF DRAGON'S FLIGHT
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Green iron ring that appears like a dragon wound around the finger
Effect: When the wearer activates the ring, dragon wings unfurl from their back, and for one minute the wearer can fly up to long range. The ring does not confer the ability to hover or make fine adjustments while in flight.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

SOULFLAYING WEAPON
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Weapon of any type, with engraved glowing runes denoting soulflaying
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its kind. The wielder can use an action to activate its soulflaying magic for one minute. During that time, if the weapon scores a hit, it inflicts normal damage, plus 3 additional points of Intellect damage on all creatures that have souls (not automatons, mindless undead, or the like).
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

SPELLBOOK OF THE AMBER MAGE
Level: 1d6
Form: Weighty tome bound in amber filled with pages of spell runes
Effect: When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level 3 Intellect-based task, the user can attempt to trap a creature within long range inside a block of amber. Only creatures whose level is equal to or lower than the artifact's level can be targeted. A creature successfully caught is preserved in perfect stasis until the encasing amber is broken away (the amber has 10 points of health per level of the artifact).
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

WAND OF FIREBOLTS
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Wand of red wood 8 inches (20 cm) long, carved with intricate flamelike images
Effect: When activated, the wand looses a blast of fire at a chosen target within short range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact's level.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

AMBER CASEMENT
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm) long
Effect: The device solidifies the air in a 10-foot (3 m) cube of space, the center of which must be within short range. The air is turned into an amberlike substance, and those trapped in it will likely suffocate or starve.
Depletion: 1-4 in 1d6

METABOLISM BUD
Level: 1d6
Form: Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of brain; once grafted to a host, the host's flesh grows over the pod until it is only a lump
Effect: The pod grafts onto any living host (usually near the brain or spine) and injects chemicals that boost the creature's metabolism. This permanently raises the host's Speed Pool maximum by 5 points.
Depletion: -

MIND IMAGER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Handheld device with a plastic panel screen and wires that must be affixed to the head of a creature
Effect: This device shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking. The affected creature need not be conscious.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

PSYCHIC CRYSTAL
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Violet crystal the size of a fist
Effect: The crystal allows the user to transmit their thoughts telepathically at an interstellar distance. Even at that range, communication is instantaneous. Each use allows about a minute's worth of communication, and the communication is entirely one way (so having two crystals would be handy).
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

REPAIR SPHERE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter
Effect: This device comes with a small module that can be affixed to a machine. Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the damage with sophisticated tools that restore 1d6 - 2 points per round (meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round). This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal to its level. The sphere must be newly activated each day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

DOCTOR DREAD'S TIME PORTAL
Level: 9
Form: Arch of metal big enough to walk through
Effect: Anyone who steps through it goes to a predetermined point in the past or future (a minimum of fifty years in either direction), which can be anywhere on the planet.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SERUM X
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Vial or syringe of red fluid
Effect: Strips someone of all superpowers (including abilities granted by magic, psionics,
mutation, or science) for twenty-four hours. The target retains only skills and abilities that are mundane, as agreed by the GM and player.
Depletion: Automatic

STELLAREX CRYSTAL
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Multifaceted purple stone the size of a fist
Effect: Created in the dawning of the universe, this artifact grants the wielder the ability to not only fully restore all their stat Pools, but also increase each Pool temporarily by 10 points. These extra points fade after twenty-four hours if not used.
Depletion: 1-3 in 1d10

AUTODOC
Level: 1d6
Form: Backpack-sized plastic module from which clamps, forceps, scalpels, and needles can extend
Effect: When strapped to a target (or when someone wearing the autodoc is damaged), the autodoc activates and restores 1 point to a target's Pools each round for ten rounds or until the target is fully healed, whichever happens first.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

ENVIROSCANNER
Level: 1d6
Form: Forearm-mounted computer tablet
Effect: This multifunction device can receive radio transmissions, automatically map locations the wearer has visited, play various forms of media, keep voice and written records, and provide an asset to any task related to interfacing with other computerized systems or machines. Also, the wearer can scan for specific materials, toxic traces, and life forms within short range.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check per use of scanning function)

MILITARY EXOSKELETON
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Articulated metal struts with deformable padding and straps for custom fit to a human frame
Effect: For one hour per use (when the exoskeleton is powered on), the wearer has +1 to their Speed Edge and +1 to their Might Edge.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

ROCKET FIST
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Metal gauntlet with flaring rocket exhaust nozzles 
Effect: If the user activates the fist as part of an attack, the punch gains a rocket assist. If the attack is successful, the fist inflicts additional damage equal to the artifact level and throws the target back a short distance.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Tube with sight and trigger
Effect: The user can make a long-range attack with a rocket-propelled grenade that inflicts 7 points of damage to the target and every creature and object next to the target.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

TERAHERTZ SCANNER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Visor fitted with bulky electronics
Effect: By emitting terahertz and long-range infrared light, this device allows a user to see a short distance through most interior walls of standard structures, through normal clothing, and into normal bags and briefcases. Only stone or concrete more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick prevents a scan. Regardless, images are black and white and fuzzy, and lack fine detail.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

BOOK OF INVERSION
Level: 8
Form: Very large book of ancient providence, the cover bound in iron and wrapped in chains with a level 6 padlock
Effect: When opened, the Book of Inversion shows a pair of pages that detail a magic spell in the reader's language, complete with disturbing diagrams. The spell's effect varies, but it is always some kind of horrible attack-a target is driven mad, a target is turned inside out, a target seeks to murder their best friend, several targets are cursed with a rotting disease, and so forth. The reader can automatically cast the spell as an action, one time only. More insidiously, if successful, the spell confers pleasure to the caster and fully restores all of their Pools. The caster must make an immediate Intellect defense roll or be compelled to use the book (and thus a new spell) again the next day. This compulsion is so strong that the caster will kill their dearest loved one to complete the task. If they are unable to use the book again, they are driven permanently mad. Woe to the caster who uses the book on the last time before it is depleted (at which point it crumbles to dust).
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

SHADOW BOX
Level: 7
Form: Wooden and black metal box, about 12 inches by 7 inches by 3 inches (30 by 18 by 8 cm), with a hinged lid and a clasp
Effect: When the box opens, shadows seethe out. These shadows coalesce into a form that best represents a deep fear in the subconscious of the person who opened the box. The opener must make an Intellect defense roll to master the shadow thing, which then acts as a level 7 creature under their control for five rounds before fading away. If the roll fails, the creature attacks the opener and anyone else around. To make matters worse, the opener spends the first round frozen in terror, doing nothing.
Depletion: 1-2 in 1d6

SPHERE 23
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A 7-inch (18 cm) sphere of what appears to be fluid metal, tinted red
Effect: Possibly one of a number of identical alien artifacts recovered in remote locales across the earth, the so-called sphere 23 will grant a wish to anyone who holds it and uses an action to concentrate on it. The wish can be anything, including something that bends reality: raising the dead, altering time, and so forth. However, the wisher must immediately make a Might defense roll or be consumed by the sphere. If the roll succeeds, they must then make an Intellect defense roll or be driven permanently and irrevocably mad.
Depletion: 1-3 in 1d6

Dimensional Modulator
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Marble-sized crisscross shape of unknown material 
Effect: A target within immediate range loses their dimension of breadth (which folds into a higher dimension), rendering them as flat as paper. The target adheres to whatever surface it was attached to, set upon, or was standing upon, and resembles particularly realistic art. An affected creature enters stasis. While in stasis, it is unable to take actions, doesn't age, and is immune to damage and effects. It remains in stasis for about a day, until the user returns the missing dimension or the artifact depletes. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Metabolic Prod
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: 1 m (4 foot) metallic rod of unknown material 
Effect: When touched to a living target (possibly as an attack), the rod injects a potent cocktail of engineered biomolecules, paralyzing the target for up to one minute. The rod wielder may also choose one of the following additional effects, if set before attacking. 
Aggression: The target's aggressive tendencies are increased for one hour, during which time the target attacks almost anything it encounters. 
Calm: The target's aggressive tendencies are tamped down for one hour, during which time the target responds to attacks but never initiates them. 
Hibernation: The target falls into hibernation, a coma-like sleep in which their metabolism slows to a crawl. They can go months with no additional food or water and with a fraction of the air they'd normally need. Loud sounds, damage, persistent prodding, and the like wakes someone in hibernation. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Probability Regulator
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Fist-sized mathematically perfect solid of constant width of unknown material 
Effect: For tasks that are usually random, the user exerts some level of control. When picking a card, rolling a die, choosing a number, or otherwise taking an action that skill usually plays no part in, they attempt an Intellect task whose difficulty is determined by how unlikely choosing correctly might be, so long as it is possible, even if unlikely. A 50/50 coin flip is a difficulty of 1, whereas picking a series of numbers with odds around 1 in 300,000,000 is difficulty 10. If successful, they achieve the desired result. 
Depletion: 1 × task difficulty in 1d20

Steorraform
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Badge-sized seven-pointed star of unknown material 
Effect: If the wearer would become debilitated or die, the worn steorraform prevents it by instantly restoring health (to a creature or an NPC) or points to a Pool (to a player character). If the wearer would die of old age, disease, or poison, the artifact prevents it by rolling back the clock by a few decades, clearing the disease, or denaturing the poison. The artifact is ineffective in preventing death when those conditions last over several rounds or more, such as falling into lava, the sun, a singularity, and so on. 
Depletion: 1 × number of previous uses in 1d20

Alpha Beam Projector
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Rifle-like device of unknown material 
Effect: The device has two settings. One fires a beam of energy that acts as propulsion and rockets the artifact away unless the user can hold onto it as a difficulty 1 Might-based task. A user could use this setting to fly a long distance each round, but doing so requires a difficulty 4 Speed-based task each round to move in the direction desired (and not plow into the ground or the side of a building). The other setting fires a reactionless beam that can be used as a very long-range plasma attack that inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The beam ignores 1 point of Armor from the target. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Carbonizer
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Pistol-like device of unknown material 
Effect: This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Death Ray
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Pistol-like device of unknown material 
Effect: This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Disintegration Beamer
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Rifle-like device with two electrodelike protrusions of unknown material 
Effect: This device fires a beam to suppress the charge of the electrons that make up a creature or object within long range, inflicting damage equal to twice the artifact's level. If the attack reduces the target's health (or combined Pools for a PC) to below the level of the artifact, the target instantly falls to dust. (A PC who would be disintegrated can spend 1 XP and instead descend one step on the damage track.) 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Empathetic Ray
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Rod-like device with very long barrel of unknown material 
Effect: This device emits an invisible beam of neural-magnetic energy as a short-range attack that instantly reverses how a level 1 target sees the user (turning an enemy into a friend, and vice versa) for up to one day. The user can adjust the settings to increase the ray's effectiveness by making one additional depletion roll per increase in the maximum level of the target. Thus, to alter the attitude of level 5 target (4 levels above the normal limit), the user must make five depletion rolls. If used against a PC, an affected PC can attempt an Intellect task to end the effect once every minute for the first few minutes, then once every hour. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

ADAMANTINE ROPE
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: A 50-foot (15 m) length of black rope
Effect: This length of rope has the flexibility of ordinary rope but a hardness greater than steel. It is impervious to damage (including attempts to cut it) from anything less than the artifact's level.
Depletion: -

ALCHEMIST BAG
Level: 1d6
Form: Embroidered velvet bag
Effect: This bag can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical potion bottle or scroll case. These cyphers do not count against a character's cypher limit.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the bag)

ARMORED CLOTH
Level: 1d6
Form: Suit of typical clothing (robe, dress, jerkin and breeches, and so on)
Effect: This clothing is soft and flexible, as expected, except when it is struck or crushed with force, at which point it hardens, providing +1 to Armor. It then immediately returns to its normal state (which is in no way encumbering). This clothing cannot be worn with armor of any kind.
Depletion: -

BELT OF STRENGTH
Level: 1d6
Form: Thick leather belt with a metal buckle and rivets
Effect: The belt enhances the strength and endurance of the wearer. This increases the wearer's maximum Might Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the belt, any excess Might points above their normal maximum Might Pool are lost; if they wear the belt again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects).
Depletion: -

BOOK OF ALL SPELLS 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes 
Effect: This mysterious spellbook is said to contain knowledge of hundreds of spells-perhaps even all spells. Each set of facing pages includes the magical runes for one spell and a description of the spell and how to use it. 
When a character first opens the book, the GM randomly determines what type of spell is shown by rolling on the following table, then rolling on the indicated table in the Cypher System Reference Document: d6 Cypher Type 1-2 Roll on the Manifest Cypher table 3-5 Roll on the Fantastic Cypher table 6 Roll on the Subtle Cypher table  The bearer can cast the spell on the page as if it were a cypher with a level equal to the book's level. This doesn't remove the spell from the page (it can be cast again and again), but it does require a depletion roll.  As part of another action, the bearer can turn the page to find a new spell, but only forward, never backward. It is said that turning to the last page makes the book vanish and appear somewhere else in the world.  The artifact always remembers the last page it was turned to. Opening the book always presents that page. Attempting to copy, remove, or destroy a page only makes the book turn to a later page on its own. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (Check each time the book is used or the bearer turns a page. The chance of depletion increases by 1 each time it is used [1 in 1d100, 2 in 1d100, 3 in 1d100, and so on]. Instead of depleting, the book might turn to a later page, or disappear and reappear somewhere else in the world.)

BOUNDING BOOTS 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Sturdy but flexible boots 
Effect: The boots assist the wearer's every step to make jumping and running easier. The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). 
Depletion: - 

CAT'S EYE SPECTACLES 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Pair of dark crystalline spectacles in a dull wooden frame 
Effect: Outside, the wearer can see at night as if it were daylight. Inside, the wearer can see in pitch darkness up to short range (or to long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 
Depletion: - 

CLOAK OF BALAKAR 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Blue cloak with elaborate designs suggesting blowing wind 
Effect: The wearer can calm winds of the artifact's level or lower in a radius of 1 mile (1.5 km). Up to once a day, the wearer can create a destructive windstorm up to that size, lasting one minute; this storm's level is equal to half the artifact's level. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (on depletion, cloak disappears and reappears somewhere else in the world) 

CLOAK OF ELFKIND 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Thin greyish-green cloak with a cowl and clasp 
Effect: When activated (by drawing the hood over the wearer's head), the cloak takes on the colors and textures of everything around the wearer for ten minutes (or one hour if the artifact is level 8 or higher). This eases hiding and sneaking tasks by two steps. While the cloak is activated, the wearer can also see in the dark. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CLOAK OF FINERY 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Multilayered cloak of glittering material 
Effect: This cloak is woven of beautiful fibers and set with dazzling gems. It automatically fits itself to its wearer in the most flattering way. When activated, it enhances the wearer's appearance, voice, tone, and even their grammar, granting an asset to all interaction tasks for the next minute. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

COIL OF ENDLESS ROPE 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Coil of rope 
Effect: The coil of rope can be let out at a rate of 50 feet (15 m) per round; however, no end to the rope can be found no matter how long the user uncoils it. The rope retains its incredible length until recoiled or until it becomes depleted. If cut, any length beyond the coil's initial 50 feet crumbles into powder after a round or two. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each use that extends it beyond 50 feet) 

CROWN OF EYES 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Metallic circlet set with several crystal spheres 
Effect: It takes one round to activate the crown. When activated, the crystal spheres separate from the crown and fly around the wearer at immediate range for an hour. The wearer can see anything the crystal spheres can see. This allows the wearer to peek around corners without being exposed to danger. This gives the wearer an asset in initiative and all perception tasks. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CROWN OF THE MIND 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Crown, circlet, headband, diadem, or amulet 
Effect: The crown augments the mind and thoughts of the wearer. This increases the wearer's maximum Intellect Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the crown, any excess Intellect points above their normal maximum Intellect Pool are lost; if they wear the crown again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects). 
Depletion: - 

CRYSTAL BALL 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Melon-sized crystalline or glass orb, with or without a support stand 
Effect: This allows the user to scry (view) remote locations and creatures. The user must make a difficulty 2 Intellect task to activate the crystal ball, then use an action trying to make it show a person or location they know. The user must succeed at an Intellect task against the level of the target; otherwise, the crystal shows only indistinct or misleading images. The task roll is modified by how familiar the target is to the user, how available they are to be viewed, and how far away they are.
Familiarity  Only have name or description Hindered Target has been visited  Eased Target is well known to the user Eased Availability Target is willing Eased Target is unwilling  Hindered Distance More than 1 mile Hindered More than 10 miles Hindered More than 100 miles Hindered These modifiers are cumulative, so trying to view a level 4 target who the user knows only by name (+1 step), is unwilling (+1 step), and is 20 miles away (+2 steps) is a difficulty 8 task.The crystal shows the creature or area for one minute before the image becomes muddled and the artifact must be activated again. 
In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to apply a level of Effort to open two-way communication with the viewed area. All creatures in the area can sense the user's presence and hear their voice, and the creatures can speak to and be heard by the user. An unwilling creature's defenses against magic and Intellect attacks should hinder scrying attempts just as they would against a directly harmful mental spell.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

DEATH'S SCYTHE 
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Double-handed scythe 
Effect: This scythe functions as a heavy weapon. In addition, it instantly kills level 1 or level 2 creatures it hits. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to use a level of Effort to affect a higher-level target; each level of Effort applied increases the level of creature that can be instantly killed by the scythe. Thus, to instantly kill a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), the wielder must apply three levels of Effort. Death manifestation: level 7.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per killing effect; upon depletion, a manifestation of Death appears to reclaim its blade)

DEMONFLESH 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Ball of black leather with vein-like red streaks 
Effect: When activated, the ball liquefies and coats the body of the user for one hour, appearing to be a form-fitting leather suit veined with pathways of dully glowing blood. As an action, the wearer can become invisible. While invisible, they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if they do something to reveal their presence or position-attacking, casting a spell, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, they can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding their position. The wearer can inflict 3 points of damage with a touch by releasing a dark crackle of demonic power. This attack ignores most Armor, but Armor made to ward against evil or demonic attacks should work against it. To randomly determine what kind of dragontongue weapon is found, see Chapter 4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

DEMONIC RUNE BLADE 
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Sword inscribed with demonic runes 
Effect: This longsword functions as a medium weapon, but it is actually a powerful demon transformed into the shape of a sword. The demon cannot speak directly to the wielder, but it can make its desires known by emitting bass rumbles and dirgelike melodies, and by pulling in the direction of its desire. The sword eases all attacks made with it by one step, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (for a total of 8 points). 
If the wielder kills a creature with the sword, the sword eats the creature's spirit and transfers some of its energy to the wielder, adding 5 points to their Might Pool and increasing their Might Edge by 1. This lasts for an hour and allows the wielder to exceed their normal Might Pool and Might Edge stats.
If the wielder misses with an attack, the blade sometimes hits an ally of the wielder instead (this always happens on an attack roll of 1). 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check each time a killed creature's life force is absorbed; if depleted, the sword's magical abilities can be recharged if it kills an “innocent” creature) 

DRAGONTONGUE WEAPON 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Weapon that roars with red flame when activated, trailing a stream of black smoke
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its type. If the wielder uses it to attack a foe, upon a successful hit, the wielder decides whether to activate the flame. Upon activation, the weapon lashes the target with fire, inflicting additional points of damage equal to the artifact level. The effect lasts for one minute after each activation. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

DRAGONTOOTH SOLDIERS 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Burlap bag containing a handful of large reptilian teeth
Effect: If a tooth is drawn from the bag and cast upon the earth, a dragontooth warrior appears, ready to fight for the user for up to ten minutes before going their own way. The user can draw several teeth at once from the bag, but each tooth drawn requires a separate depletion roll. Dragontooth warrior: level equal to the artifact level, Speed defense as artifact level + 1 due to shield; Armor 1; spear attack (melee or short range) inflicts damage and impedes movement of victim to immediate range for one round.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

ELFBLADE 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Medium sword
Effect: This sword can be used as a normal medium sword that deals 2 additional points of damage (for a total of 6 points). The short sword can cut through any material of its level or lower with ease, owing to its exceptional sharpness. The blade sheds a blue light as bright as a candle to warn when goblins, orcs, trolls, or similar creatures are within 300 feet (90 m). 
Depletion: - 

ENCHANTED ARMOR 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor 
Effect: This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor (or +2 if the artifact is level 7 or higher) beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so enchanted chainmail provides a total of 3 Armor (for artifact level 6 or lower) or 4 Armor (for artifact level 7 or higher). 
The additional Armor provided by the magic also applies to damage that often isn't reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage). 
Depletion: -

EXPLODING ARROW 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Arrow with runes carved on the shaft and head 
Effect: The arrow explodes when it strikes something, inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range. Roll d100 to determine the type of damage. 01-20 Acid 21-40 Electricity 41-60 Cold 61-90 Fire 91-00 Necromantic (harms only flesh) One advantage of an exploding arrow over a detonation cypher is that the arrow doesn't count toward your cypher limit. 
An exploding arrow can instead be a crossbow bolt, sling stone, or other thrown weapon or projectile.
Depletion: Automatic 

EXPLORER'S GLOVES 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Thick but flexible-fingered leather gloves 
Effect: The wearer can cling to or climb any surface for up to one hour. Even level 10 climbing tasks become routine while the gloves are activated, but taking any other action while climbing requires a new activation. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

FALCON CLOAK
Level: 1d6 
Form: Cloak made of feathers 
Effect: For ten hours, the wearer becomes a falcon whose level is equal to the artifact level. The falcon can fly a long distance each round, or up to 60 miles (97 km) per hour when traveling overland. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

FLYING CARPET
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Silken rug with repeating designs bordered with a pattern that suggests scudding clouds 
Effect: The carpet flies a long distance each round, carrying up to five passengers. It flies for up to ten hours per activation. When traveling overland, the artifact can achieve a flying speed of 60 miles (97 km) per hour. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

GHOSTLY ARMOR 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor 
Effect: This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so ghostly chainmail provides 3 Armor. 
When activated, the armor randomly makes the wearer ghostly and immaterial for ten minutes (or for one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps without hindering any of the character's abilities. Special multidimensional weapons or attacks (such as abilities meant to harm ghosts) ignore this defense. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (for the ghostly defense ability, but after depletion, the suit still functions as normal armor and provides its full Armor value)

GLOVES OF AGILITY 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Supple leather or cloth gloves 
Effect: The gloves enhance the dexterity and reflexes of the wearer. This increases the wearer's maximum Speed Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the gloves, any excess Speed points above their normal maximum Speed Pool are lost; if they wear the gloves again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects). 
Depletion: - 

GRUELMAKER 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Clay bowl stamped with symbols of fish and birds 
Effect: The bowl fills itself to the brim with a bland-tasting tan porridge that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (or two people if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

GUARDIAN IDOL 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Demonic idol on top of a thin metal leg that is 1 foot (30 cm) tall 
Effect: It takes two rounds to balance this artifact on its metal leg, and then it requires an action to activate. When activated, the idol stares at the activating character and nearby creatures for five rounds, memorizing their faces and shapes. After that, if anything the idol doesn't recognize (and is larger than a mouse) comes within long range, it spits a small ball of fire at the target. The fire inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The idol can attack up to ten times per round, but it never attacks the same target more than once per round. It remains on watch for twenty-four hours or until it has made one hundred attacks, whichever comes first. 
Depletion: Automatic

HAND OF GLORY 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Dried humanoid hand with candle-tip fingers 
Effect: A hand of glory has several potential uses, including the following. In all cases, the candles making up the hand must be lit and burning to produce an effect. Insensibility: A target within short range is held motionless and unable to take actions as long as the lit hand remains within range (or until the target is attacked or otherwise snapped out of the trance). Invisibility: User is invisible for up to one minute while holding the hand. While invisible, the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. Thief 's Passage: A locked or barred door or a container whose level is less than or equal to the hand's level becomes unlocked when touched by the hand. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

HELM OF WATER BREATHING 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Green metal helm with a scaly or fishy motif 
Effect: The wearer's head is enveloped in a tight bubble of air that constantly renews itself, allowing them to breathe underwater indefinitely, speak normally, and so on. 
Depletion: 1-2 in 1d100 (check each day) 

HORN OF THUNDER 
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Large signal horn banded with metal and carved with runes 
Effect: This massive instrument can barely be held or carried by a single person. When activated, it emits a 50-foot (15 m) wide cone of pure sonic force out to long range. Any creature in that area is knocked prone and stunned for one round, losing its action. Unfixed items the size of a human or smaller are toppled and/or moved at least 5 feet (1.5 m). Larger objects might also be toppled. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

INSTANT LADDER 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Small lightweight metal rod with gem buttons 
Effect: When activated, the rod extends and produces rungs so that it can be used as a ladder up to 28 feet (9 m) long. The ladder can be transformed back into its rod form from either end. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

LIGHTNING HAMMER 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Massive silver hammer that crackles with electricity 
Effect: This hammer functions as a normal heavy weapon. However, if the wielder uses an action to activate it, the weapon radiates electricity for one round. If used to attack on the next round, the hammer inflicts an additional 10 points of electricity damage. The user can choose to strike the ground instead, sending shockwaves of electricity outward that deal 5 points of damage to everyone within short range. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (still usable as a normal heavy weapon after depletion)

MASTERCRAFT ARMOR 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Armor of exceptional quality 
Effect: This armor grants its wearer an asset for Speed defense rolls. 
Depletion: - 

MASTERCRAFT WEAPON 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Weapon of exceptional quality 
Effect: This weapon grants its wielder an asset for attack rolls made with it. 
Depletion: - 

MINDSHIELD HELMET 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Lightweight cloth, leather, or metal helmet 
Effect: The wearer gains 3 Armor that protects against Intellect damage only. Further, attempts to affect the wearer's mind are hindered (or hindered by two steps if the artifact is level 7 or higher). 
Depletion: - 

NECROMANTIC WAND 
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Bone wand carved with runes 
Effect: This wand emits a faint short-range beam of sickly violet light that affects only organic creatures and materials. Living targets hit by the beam move one step down the damage track. Nonliving organic targets are likely destroyed. This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

PACK OF STORAGE 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Leather backpack or haversack with multiple pockets
Effect: This pack's mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2 m) in diameter. It is larger on the inside than on the outside, and can carry up to 500 pounds (226 kg) or 10 cubic feet (.3 cubic m). The pack weighs about one-tenth as much as it is holding. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack; on depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack) 

POISONER'S TOUCH 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Very thin transparent glove with faint markings
Effect: When the wearer activates the glove (which might require speaking a command word or tracing a specific pattern on its surface), it secretes a small amount of poison. The next creature the wearer touches with the glove takes Speed damage equal to the artifact level (ignores Armor) and must make a new Might defense roll each round or suffer the damage again until either they succeed at the defense roll or five rounds pass, whichever comes first. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

PROTECTION AMULET 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Stylized amulet worn on a chain 
Effect: The amulet reduces one type of damage by an amount equal to the artifact level. Roll a d20 to determine the kind of damage the amulet protects against. 1-4 Acid 5-8 Cold 9-12 Electricity 13-16 Fire 17-20 Poison.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each time the amulet reduces damage)

RING OF FALL FLOURISHING 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Gold band inscribed with feather wreath 
Effect: The wearer of the ring can fall any distance safely, landing easily and upright. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

RING OF INVISIBILITY 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Gold band inscribed with characters that are revealed only if ring is heated 
Effect: The wearer of the ring becomes invisible for one minute. While invisible, the wearer is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. The effect ends if they attack or spend points from a Pool for any reason. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

RING OF WISHES 
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Plain gold band 
Effect: The user makes a wish, and it is granted, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the artifact, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect accordingly. (The larger the wish, the more likely the GM will limit its effect.) 
Depletion: 1-3 in 1d6 

SHIELD OF TWO SKIES 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Small hexagonal amulet 
Effect: Upon activation, the amulet creates a faint glow around the wearer that provides +2 to Armor against heat and cold (or +3 for artifact level 6 and higher). The effect lasts for ten minutes. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

SKILL RING
Level: 1d6 
Form: Ring carved with sigils appropriate to its granted skill 
Effect: This ring grants its wearer knowledge of a specific skill, such as climbing, jumping, history, or persuasion. This grants the wearer training in that skill (or in two skills if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 
Depletion: - 

SMOOTH-STEPPING BOOTS 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Pair of boots 
Effect: When the boots are activated, for the next hour the wearer can move across rough or difficult terrain at normal speed, walk up walls, and even walk across liquids. In areas of low or no gravity, the wearer can walk along hard surfaces (even vertically or upside down) as if under normal gravity. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

SOUL-STEALING KNIFE 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Night-black blade in which distant stars are sometimes visible 
Effect: This knife functions as a normal light weapon. However, if the wielder wishes, on a successful attack, it inflicts additional damage (ignores Armor) equal to the artifact's level. If damage from the dagger reduces a target to 0 health, the target's soul is drawn into the blade. The soul remains trapped there for up to three days, after which time it is consumed. (Alternatively, the wielder can release the soul to whatever its fate would otherwise be.) 
As a separate activation, the wielder can ask three questions of a creature whose soul is trapped in the blade and not yet consumed. After answering the third question, the soul is consumed. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each activation)

SOVEREIGN KEY 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Slender golden key 
Effect: When touched to a lock or the surface of a sealed object (such as a chest, envelope, or urn), the key briefly glows and attempts to open the target. Sealed objects fall open like peeled fruits if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level, and locks open easily if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

SPELLBOOK OF ELEMENTAL SUMMONING 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes 
Effect: When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level 3 Intellect task, they can summon an elemental of one specific kind described in the book (earth, fire, thorn, or some other type). The elemental appears and does the summoner's bidding for up to one hour, unless it somehow breaks the geas created by the book. 
Depletion: 1-3 in 1d20

STAFF OF BLACK IRON 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Staff of black iron set with an eye-shaped crystal headpiece 
Effect: The wielder can use an action to gain one of the following effects. 
Influence: The wielder makes a mental attack on a creature within immediate range by providing a suggestion. An affected target follows any suggestion during its next turn that doesn't cause direct harm to itself or its allies. 
Lightning: The wielder discharges a bolt of lightning that attacks all targets along a straight line out to long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level. 
Shield: For one hour, the wielder gains the protective effect of using a normal shield (an asset on their Speed defense rolls). This effect is invisible and doesn't require them to hold a shield; merely touching the staff is sufficient. 
The staff can have more than one effect ongoing at a time (such as using the shield ability and blasting someone with lightning), but each requires a separate activation and depletion roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

STAFF OF HEALING
Level: 1d6 + 4 
Form: Wooden staff capped with a golden icon 
Effect: The staff emits a short-range beam of silvery light that affects only living creatures. A living creature hit by the beam moves up one step on the damage track. A target that is not down on the damage track can immediately make a free recovery roll (or, for NPCs, regain a number of points of health equal to three times their level). 
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

STAFF OF THE PROPHET 
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: Short wooden staff 
Effect: The staff has three abilities, each of which requires an action to activate. 
Sea Passage. Creates a dry route through a body of water. The route is approximately 20 feet (6 m) wide, up to 1,000 feet (300 m) deep, and as long as the body of water is wide. The path remains open for up to four hours, or the wielder can collapse it as an action. 
Snake Form. Staff transforms into a venomous snake whose level is equal to the artifact level. The snake has a bite attack that inflicts 6 points of damage, plus 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll. The snake obeys the wielder's verbal commands, but it can't do anything a regular snake couldn't do. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

STORM SHACK 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Miniature model of a simple wooden shack 
Effect: Activating the artifact transforms it over the next few rounds into a simple wooden shack that is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) with a thin door. Everything inside the area of the full-size shack is protected from most forms of inclement weather for one hour (or ten hours for artifact level 6 and higher). Leaving or entering the shack before the duration is up makes it harmlessly collapse upon itself unless the character succeeds on a Speed roll against the artifact's level. If collapsed early or the duration runs out, the shack collapses into sticks, dust, and the miniature model, which can be taken and reused. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

TRAP RUNESTONE 
Level: 1d6 
Form: Pouch with chalk, sealing wax, and an engraved runestone 
Effect: A simple cypher (such as a potion or scroll) can be modified with this set of implements to turn it into a trap. First, the cypher is attached to a surface with the sealing wax, then the user must make a difficulty 4 Intellect task to draw the runestone symbols around the edge of the cypher with the chalk and place the runestone in the correct position. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people often use straightforward cyphers such as an explosive spell scroll, a poisonous potion, and so on. 
The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)-a door opening, a creature or object moving past the runestone, and so on. The higher the level of the artifact, the more sophisticated the trigger. For example, a level 4 artifact's trigger might be based on a creature's size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a specific type of creature, and a level 6 artifact can trigger based on recognizing an individual creature. 
Depletion: Automatic 

TUNNELING GAUNTLETS 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Oversized pair of metallic gauntlets with broad nails 
Effect: When activated, for one hour the gauntlets let the wearer burrow up to an immediate distance each round. They can burrow through most soils and even some stone, but only through material whose level is lower than the artifact level. Burrowing leaves behind a tunnel with a diameter of 5 feet (1.5 m) that remains stable for several hours. After that, the tunnel is subject to collapse. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

VORPAL SWORD 
Level: 1d6 + 3 
Form: Long sword that sometimes whispers and snickers aloud 
Effect: The vorpal sword cuts through any material of a level lower than its own. It is a medium weapon that ignores Armor of a level lower than its own. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, the suggested minor or major effect is decapitation if the artifact is higher level than the foe (use this only if the foe has a head; otherwise, choose a different effect). 
Depletion: 1-2 in 1d100 (check each decapitation and specific attempt to cut through solid material) 

WAND OF SPIDER'S WEBBING 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: White oak wand 
Effect: This wand produces a long-range stream of grey spider's webbing that entangles a target and holds it stuck to nearby surfaces. Entangled victims can't move or take actions that require movement. Targets whose level is higher than the wand's level can usually break free within one or two rounds. The entangling web is highly flammable, and if ignited it burns away over the course of one round, but the intense heat inflicts damage equal to the artifact level on whatever was caught within it.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

WHISPERER IN THE ETHER 
Level: 1d6 + 1 
Form: Small crystal 
Effect: The bearer of this crystal can telepathically communicate with an immortal being whose location is unknown (probably another dimension or a godly or infernal realm). The user can converse with the intelligence on an ongoing basis, but in general, the whisperer can share a useful bit of information, insight, or advice about once every day. Sometimes, this translates into an asset on one of the user's actions. For example, the intelligence can suggest the right phrase to make friends with a shopkeeper to get a good deal, the right tools to use while trying to break open a door, or the right place to put a shield to deflect an incoming attack. Sometimes the information is more broad, such as the right road to take to reach the next town or why a group of monsters is attacking the caravan the bearer is guarding. 
The whisperer's willingness and ability to converse varies considerably. Sometimes it is quite chatty and offers advice. Other times, it must be convinced, cajoled, or tricked into giving information. And sometimes, it is entirely absent for reasons it will not explain. The whisperer's knowledge base is broad but not omniscient. It cannot see the future, but it can often predict outcomes based on logic. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day)

WITCH'S BROOM
Level: 1d6 + 2 
Form: A 6-foot (2 m) long wooden broom 
Effect: As a vehicle, the broom can be ridden a long distance each round. On extended trips, it can move up to 100 miles (160 km) per hour. 
The bearer can call upon the broom to grant them a powerful hallucinogenic state that lasts for four hours, during which time all tasks are hindered. After the hallucinations end, the bearer's Intellect tasks are eased for the next ten minutes. 
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

DARKEST BOOK
Level: 10
Form: Large, metal-bound book
Effect: Fashioned by the primordial entity who created evil magic, the Darkest Book is a record of every vile incantation, curse, and ritual ever performed. It is known to include spells that create werewolves, raise an army of zombies, revive a dead body as a vampire, conjure demons and devils, and release profane energy for various effects. It eases by three steps any task related to magical lore. Even someone unskilled at magic can open it to a random page and read the spell there (the GM randomly determines the spell by rolling on the Fantastic Cypher table), which takes effect at level 10. The Darkest Book is somewhat sentient and can hide its words from anyone it doesn't want reading it. It might require a person casting a spell from it to succeed at a difficulty 6 Intellect defense roll or take 6 points of Intellect damage and move one step down the damage track.The book is technically indestructible; anything strong enough to destroy an object of its level merely destroys one of its pages, and the book can't be destroyed as long as at least one page remains.
Depletion: =

OMNI ORB
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Glowing, orb-shaped technological device 
Effect: The user holding the orb imagines what they want to happen (similar to using a magical wish), and it happens, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the orb, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect accordingly. (The larger the desired effect, the more likely the GM will limit it.) Activating the omni orb automatically moves the character using it one step down the damage track. A benchmark for setting an omni orb's limits is to compare it to a cypher of the orb's level—if there is a cypher that can do what the PC wants, and that cypher is equal to or less than the orb's level, it works. For example, if a team of superheroes tries to use a level 5 orb to teleport to their base 100 miles away, the GM can look at the list of cyphers and see that a teleporter (traveler) cypher can transport one character up to 100 miles per cypher level, so transporting a group of PCs 100 miles is probably within the orb's power
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (instead of depleting, a roll of 1 means the user experiences a GM intrusion related to the effect they created)

SPACE RING
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Metal ring with a star insignia
Effect: The wearer is able to fly as effortlessly as walking, moving up to a short distance each round in any direction. In space, if the wearer does nothing but move for three actions in a row, they accelerate greatly and can move up to 200 miles (320 km) per hour, or about 2,000 feet (600 m) each round. The ring also provides the wearer with breathable air while in space or underwater (although this doesn't provide protection against poison gas or other air-based hazards). The wearer can verbally communicate with other ring-wearers within 1 mile (1.5 km), and verbally request information (relayed to them with a synthesized voice) from the internet or a local equivalent.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each day of flying)

A Tisket a Tasket
Level: 1d6
Form: Woven yellow basket with wooden handles
Effect: This basket can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical cat. Cyphers in the basket do not count against a character's limit.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the basket)

Bounding Boots
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Beautifully made leather and gold boots that adjust to fit the wearer perfectly
Effect: The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
Depletion: -

Boundless Bag
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small bag with two handles and a clasp
Effect: Any nonliving item held in the bag becomes a slightly more valuable item. For example, an inexpensive item becomes a moderately priced item, while a moderate item becomes an expensive item. The bag has no effect on items that are very expensive or exorbitant. The change takes a full day to take effect, during which time the item cannot leave the bag and the bag should not be opened. If the bag is opened, the process is canceled and must be started over. Putting all or part of a living thing into a boundless bag is always risky, as more than one person has had their hand or head turned to gold (which might sound lovely, but typically isn't). Also, doing so often causes the boundless bag to revert to a normal bag. Items that create wealth in any fashion are particularly sought after. So much so that some items are believed to be cursed, due to the number of people who have met their untimely fate while in possession of a wealth-making artifact.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6. When the effect depletes, it can still be used as a normal bag.

Boy Blue's Horn
Level: 1d6
Form: Gleaming horn that never needs to be tuned or polished
Effect: When playing a lullaby, the horn puts every hearing living being in short range (including the user) to sleep for two rounds. When the horn plays something upbeat, the user and all allies within short range add +1 to their recovery rolls for ten minutes.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20. After depletion, it continues to function as a regular horn.

Carving Knife of Sharpness
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Knife (light weapon)
Effect: This weapon functions as a normal knife of its kind. When the wielder gets a special major effect when attacking, they can choose to lop off one of the target's limbs. The GM determines the effect of a lost limb; however, many magical beings can withstand lost limbs with far more aplomb than a mortal creature will display in a similar situation.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (roll on each major effect)

Devils and Tailors
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Blood-stained draughtboard with figures of white gold, bronze, and pearl
Effect: Playing someone in a game of checkers or draughts eases all of the user's positive social interactions with their opponent. While playing, the user can make a move and interact with their opponent as a single action. The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. You can determine the outcome of a game by having both players roll 2d6. The player with the highest number of pieces left on the board (highest roll) is the winner.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each game played). After depletion, the board continues to function as a regular draughtboard.

Fiddle of the Fossegrim
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Water-worn fiddle
Effect: Playing the fiddle causes everyone within long distance to become enticed by the music and draw closer to the player. After one round, all creatures in short range begin to dance uncontrollably for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. The only action they can take while dancing is to attempt to break free from the effect (an Intellect action equal to the artifact level).
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Fortunate's Purse
Level: 1d6
Form: Elegant knapsack that shifts colors to hide in plain sight. Magic bags come in many forms, such as coin purses, sacks, packs, and pockets. Some can be used to hide someone safely out of sight, provide an endless supply of gold or riches, or grant wishes. They are most often given as rewards for doing great kindnesses or completing a difficult task.
Effect: Any object put inside the sack cannot be detected by physical senses or magic. The sack can hold a single item, of any size and shape, at a time. Cyphers in Fortunate's purse do not count against the user's cypher limit.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time an item is added to the knapsack)

Galoshes of Fortune
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Pair of rubber boots
Effect: Transports the wearer to a time and place in the past or present that they desire for up to ten minutes. The wearer cannot be seen, heard, or sensed by others, and they cannot take any actions other than to watch events unfold. Traveling to and from the time and place causes the wearer to disappear from the present for two rounds.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Genie's Lamp
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Bronze oil lamp. Genies, also called djinn or jinn, come in many forms, and not all of them are contained or controlled by something so simple as a lamp.
Effect: Rubbing the lamp produces a genie who grants the user a wish. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish per day.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Golden Bridle
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Bridle made of flowing gold
Effect: To activate the bridle, the user must succeed on an Intellect interaction with a beast whose level does not exceed the artifact level. The bridle bonds to the creature, which immediately becomes calm. The creature awaits the user's commands and carries out orders to the best of its ability. The creature remains calmed for a number of hours equal to the artifact's level minus the creature's level. (If the result is 0 or less, the creature is enslaved for only one minute.)
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Hatchet of the Woodsman
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Well-worn hatchet of unremarkable appearance
Effect: When used on a creature, the hatchet turns the target into wood and inflicts damage equal to its level. If the creature is living wood, the hatchet turns them into nonliving wood. If the target is slain by the hatchet, the creature becomes animated wood. Effects last for ten minutes or until the target succeeds on an Intellect roll.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check on each successful attack)

Hook's Hook
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Simple iron hook designed to be worn as a prosthetic
Effect: When placed on an amputated limb, the hook grafts on permanently. It works as a simple hook and as a light weapon. When activated, Hook's hook affects the minds of all thinking foes within long range. Those affected are instilled with terror, making them drop whatever they're holding and flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. There are rumored to be any number of Hook's hooks, all of which are made from different materials and serve different purposes, such as the scissors hook, oar hook, magnet hook, teacup hook, grappling-hook hook, and fishing rod hook. Enterprising characters might seek out multiple hooks, along with a way to exchange them easily.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (for the fear ability). After depletion, it still functions as a hook and a weapon.

Horn of Destruction
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Large brass horn
Effect: Blowing into the horn destroys all objects in an immediate area that is up to a long distance away, turning it all into rubble and debris. Living beings inside the area take 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). It is customary for the one who holds the horn of destruction to call themselves the King of Rubble and Debris and to wear a crown fashioned from talus and scree.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Iron Stove
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Iron stove that walks and talks
Effect: Once per day, the stove can bake a
living gingerbread cookie. The baker chooses the form, but it must be a simple, one-dimensional shape (such as a human, a dog, or a tree). The cookie is a level 3 creature that can move, talk, and complete simple tasks that the baker asks of it. After a day, the cookie crumbles away. Additionally, the iron stove can be used as a regular stove to heat water, cook meals, and so on. A gingerbread being is not immune to dangers. Large amounts of liquids are likely to make it melt away, while birds and other scavengers have been known to try to take an eye or leg.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100. After depletion, it remains a regular working stove, but no longer walks and talks.

Knapsack of Sevens
Level: 1d6
Form: Simple knapsack
Effect: Tapping the knapsack seven times causes seven swans to fly out. For as long as the user does not speak or make any sounds, the swans fly around the user, providing them with +1 Armor against mental and physical attacks for the next ten minutes. As soon as the user utters a sound, the swans return to the knapsack.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Mirror Mirror
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Ornate mirror that grows or shrinks in size according to its user's needs.
Effect: When the user looks into the mirror and interacts with it, it grants their request, as it is able. Most mirror mirrors have a personality all their own. Some sing their answers, some show images, and still others sigh with boredom at being asked the same thing over and over. Mirrors never lie. Except when they do. Roll a d6 to determine the mirror's ability:
Depletion: 1 in 1d20
OPTION TABLE
1 Answers a question about the present (such as "Who is the fairest of them all?") with a simple one- or two-word answer.
2 Allows the viewer to check in on someone they know (and who knows them) from anywhere. The image lasts just a moment, and those being viewed are not aware that it has happened.
3 If the viewer stands before the mirror and shouts their own name three times, they are granted a glimpse of their future. This glimpse lasts just a moment, and is not guaranteed to come true.
4 If the viewer stands before the mirror at midnight while holding a light source, they are able to contact the ghost or spirit of a person or creature they know the name of. Whether or not the being agrees to talk with them is another matter.
5 Distorts the appearance of everything it reflects, particularly by magnifying the horrible and ugly aspects of things and people while ignoring their good and beautiful aspects. Looking into the mirror inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Angling the mirror to reflect an object inflicts 2 points of damage to it.
6 Coats the user's skin with its reflective surface, offering protection. The first time the user would take damage, the mirror shatters instead, reflecting the damage back to the user's attacker.

Pandora's Box
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Elegant gold box with a hinged lid and a locked clasp
Effect: When the box is opened, light leaks out. The light coalesces into a golden form that represents a deep sense of peace and hope to the person who opened the box. For a number of rounds equal to the artifact level, the golden form eases all actions taken by the opener. Alternatively, the opener can share the effect of the golden form as their action, easing all actions taken by allies within short range (but not giving themselves the benefits).
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Pixie Dust
Level: 1d6
Form: Glass bottle filled with glittering light
Effect: Shake the glittering light on a living being and it can fly for ten minutes per artifact level. If the being can already fly, shaking the light on them grounds them, taking away their ability to be airborne for the same amount of time.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Red Cap
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Woolen cap soaked in human blood
Effect: The wearer gains an extra recovery roll each day that is not an action and does not count toward their daily limit. Once the wearer uses this recovery roll, they can't do so again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll and soak the hat in fresh human blood.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day of use)

Red Riding Hood
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Bright red cloak that adjusts to fit its wearer
Effect: Draws the eye while also giving the wearer the impression of being easy prey. All tasks involving sneaking and hiding are hindered, and foes will typically attack the wearer over any others in the area. The cloak provides +3 Armor and an asset to all Might-based tasks, including combat tasks.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check each day of use)

Self-Swinging Sword
Level: 1d6 + 1
Form: Steel sword with an ornate hilt
Effect: When activated by a special word, the sword attacks whoever the user indicates, fighting as a creature whose level is equal to the artifact level. Commanding the sword is not an action, but it can only do things that a sword would be able to do (attack, block, slice, and so on). If the sword is reduced to 0 health, the self-swinging ability ends and must be reactivated. The sword returns to the user when the duration ends.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (for the self-swinging ability). After depletion, it functions as a regular sword.

Seven-League Boots
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Lace-up knee-high boots of black leather
Effect: Allows the wearer to travel up to 21 miles (34 km) with a single step. Alternatively, two people may each wear one boot and travel up to 10.5 miles (19 km) with a single step. Seven-league boots exhaust the user, costing them 2 Might points per step.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each step). Once the movement ability depletes, the boots continue to function as regular boots.

Shapeshifter Wand
Level: 1d6
Form: Wand made of wood, glass, metal, or stone
Effect: Allows the user to turn one living being (including themself) into one of the following: flower, lake, duck, swan, cottage, rosebush, or fish. While in their new form, the shapeshifted being retains all of their health and other attributes, but cannot perform any actions beyond what the non-magical item or creature could normally perform. So a flower can blow in the wind, bloom, attract insects, be cut, and smell nice. Any attempts to detect the shapeshifted being by physical senses or magic are hindered by two steps. While shapeshifted, the being cannot die; however, they can be injured, cursed, or moved down the damage track. The effect lasts for ten minutes or until the user chooses to end it early.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

She-Bear
Level: 1d6
Form: Bit of wood carved in the shape of a bear
Effect: When placed in the mouth, changes the wielder into the form of a female bear. While in this form, the user gains +4 to their Might Pool, +4 to their Speed Pool, and +1 to Armor. They also can communicate with other bears while in this form. The effect lasts for ten minutes.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Shirt of Nettles
Level: 1d6 + 4
Form: Woven shirt of stinging nettles
Effect: The shirt acts as light armor, but grants an additional +2 Armor (+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 1 Armor that light armor typically provides. Additionally, the wearer can't be shapeshifted against their will.
Depletion: - (At any time, the GM can rule that the shirt has resisted enough shapeshifting magic to deplete that ability, after which the shirt still functions as armor.)

Soldier's Cloak of Invisibility
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Slate-grey cloak sewn of shadows and silence
Effect: Provides an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected (even by magic) for as long as the wearer does not interact with another creature. Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in any way breaks the effect.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Soulful Fiddle
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Fiddle made of bone and guts
Effect: This instrument acts like a normal fiddle of its kind. If the wielder is trained in its use and plays an appropriate tune, those within short range who hear it suffer one of the following effects: fall asleep, become amenable to suggestion, follow the fiddle player in a light trance, or take a similar action. The desired effect must be the same for all creatures who hear it. The effect lasts for ten minutes, but actions by others (such as attacking the listeners or physically restraining them) can end the effect early for a creature.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Steadfast Tin Soldier
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small tin soldier with one leg
Effect: Gives a user who is missing a limb the ability to transform the tin soldier into a prosthetic limb with the appearance of their choosing. The limb permanently increases the user's maximum Speed Pool or Might Pool (user's choice) by 5 points (or 7 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). It is rumored that there are a number of artifacts that create prosthetic body parts or restore missing limbs, including Paper Ballerina, Handless Maiden, and Bianca's Snake.
Depletion: -

Stone Canoe
Level: 1d6 + 3
Form: Shiny grey pebble, small enough to fit into a pocket
Effect: When activated, forms into a canoe that can carry a number of beings (and their equipment) equal to the artifact level. The canoe lasts for one day and then transforms back into a pebble.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each use)

Story Knife
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small penknife inscribed with tiny words in hundreds of languages
Effect: Slices through words that are in the form of oral stories, songs, speeches, conversations, and so on. This has one of two effects, depending on the wielder's desire (the wielder must decide before they activate the artifact each time): Makes the story, song, and so on sharper, stronger, and more interesting, increasing the chance that it will have an impact on listeners (eases any attempted interaction task). Makes the story, song, and so on boring, unwieldy, and disjointed, decreasing the chance that it will have the intended impact on listeners (hinders any attempted interaction task) Using the story knife is an action. It has no power to cut physical objects or living beings (unless those beings are made of stories).
Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Table-Be-Set
Level: 1d6
Form: Common-looking wooden table
Effect: Putting the table out and saying "Table be set" automatically fills the table with as much food and drink as will fit upon its surface. The table does not become empty as long as there is anyone in long range who still wishes to eat. Once a character uses the table's ability, they can't do so again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll. In addition to artifact quirks, common sense suggests that the effects of some artifacts will draw additional interesting opportunities or dangers. Using table-be-set in the middle of a forest, for example, is likely to draw bears and other hungry beasts, while using it in the middle of town might garner the characters new friends, or catch the attention of thieves.
Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Tinderbox
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Small ornate tinderbox made of metal
Effect: Summons three dogs to do the user's bidding. The dogs can complete any tasks dogs would normally be able to accomplish, including carrying, fetching, attacking, defending, and so on. They act as a single level 3 creature.
Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Tweedledee's Umbrella
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Large umbrella with a sharp point on the end
Effect: Touch a creature (up to the artifact's level) of any size and the umbrella will fold up around it, capturing it inside. Holding the umbrella with the captive inside is an action. A caught character is held for ten minutes or until they make a successful Might roll to break free.
Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Vicious Tankard
Level: 1d6 + 2
Form: Hefty ale tankard carved of stone
Effect: In addition to serving as a convenient means to drink a variety of liquids, if the tankard is topped off with good ale or spirits, it can be used as a medium weapon that inflicts +2 damage (for a total of 6 points of damage). Anyone who picks up the tankard is practiced in using it in this fashion. Surprisingly, using the tankard as a melee weapon does not cause more than a modicum of good ale or spirits to slosh out.
Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each fight)
