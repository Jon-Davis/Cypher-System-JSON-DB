OPTION TABLE VACUUM GM INTRUSIONS
In terms of game mechanics, an unprotected character in vacuum moves one step down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If not, they die
01 The character notices a crack in their space suit or ship. It’s not breached now, but may soon become a serious problem.
02 A breach in another part of the ship or space station causes automatic safety pressure baffles to close that section off. A character might be caught in that area of the ship, or in an area of a descending baffle, which inflicts serious damage on the character (these things are made to resist obstructions and form a seal).
03 A previously unknown crack in a space suit or ship begins to leak. It doesn’t cause a blow-out, but unless the crack can be repaired or sealed, those affected will eventually be exposed to vacuum.
04 A catastrophic blow-out exposes the character or characters to vacuum. It may also send them spiraling out into the void, depending on the situation.
05 Vacuum exposure causes the character to projectile vomit, effectively rendering them unable to take an action on their next turn.
06 Vacuum exposure causes the character to go temporarily blind, which is only relieved a few minutes after normal atmosphere is restored.


OPTION TABLE SPACE SUITS GM INTRUSIONS
Even if advanced tech or fantastic tech is available, space suits are susceptible to all kinds of mishaps. Of course, that’s especially true for contemporary tech space suits, which work hard at keeping a constant internal air volume so that a wearer doesn’t have to continually exert themselves to hold the suit in a given position or pre-breathe oxygen at a higher concentration. “Hard-shell” suits manage this with multiple joints and segments that shift on ball bearings, and by being able to maintain a higher internal pressure than soft suits.
01 An ill-fitted suit (or one whose auto-fit function is malfunctioning) unexpectedly hinders the character’s action
02 Mechanical joints in the suit freeze unexpectedly, hindering all the character’s actions (or completely paralyzing the character) until repairs can be made.
03 A stuck valve causes the drinking water bulb to get stuck “on” and water begins filling the helmet. This could blind and/or drown the character if not dealt with
04 Space sickness/a tumble/a spin nauseates the character. If they vomit in their helmet, they are blinded until such time as the helmet can be removed and cleaned.
05 An electrical short from an external tool or piece of hardware fries the space suit’s electronics, limiting communication to helmet-to helmet touch (if in a vacuum where sound doesn’t propagate), use of micro thrusters, and limits air supply to just a quarter of what was previously available.
06 A bloated suit from an overpressure incident hinders all tasks, but is not lethal . . . until the suit won’t quite fit back into the airlock.

OPTION TABLE ACCELERATION AND HIGH-G MANEUVER GM INTRUSIONS
In a fantastic tech setting where gravitic control usually cancels inertia, spacecraft acceleration (or deceleration) is only an issue when the gravitic systems malfunction. But acceleration is always something everyone has to deal with in contemporary or advanced tech settings.
01 After high-G maneuvers, even with amelioration, tissue bruising results, giving the character black eyes, which take a few days to clear.
02 While under high Gs, a tool or piece of equipment comes loose, accelerates through the craft, and strikes the character, inflicting damage. The bigger the tool and the farther it falls before striking the character, the more damage is inflicted, possibly including being knocked a step down the damage track.
03 While under high Gs (or afterward), the character suffers minor cardiac problems, likely to grow worse over time (or until medical treatment is sought).
04 While under high Gs (or afterward), a mild brain aneurysm causes the character to have a sudden headache and blurred vision, which hinders all vision-related tasks until medical treatment is received.
05 While under high Gs (or afterward), the character begins to have a hard time breathing. The reason is that a lung or lungs have partially collapsed. All tasks are hindered by two steps until the character dies after several hours or until medical treatment is received. 
06 The character has a stroke, and descends two steps on the damage track. They remain debilitated until medical treatment is received

OPTION TABLE SPACE HEALTH HAZARD GM INTRUSIONS
In a setting with contemporary tech, a variety of issues related to long-term exposure to micro-gravity and high radiation beset astronauts, including bone and muscle loss, less circulating blood and red cell mass, less ability to constrict and dilate in vessels, irregular hormones, diminished immune system, inability of mitochondria to initiate wound healing, and even shortened telomeres. The inability to heal even minor wounds and nicks until a space-farer returns to stronger gravity will eventually prove lethal, though a snapped bone or normally inconsequential virus or parasite could also do them in.
01 Space sickness happens to everyone eventually. Nauseated characters are hindered in all tasks and may vomit unexpectedly.
02 A wrist bone, thinner than it should be due to long-term exposure to microgravity, breaks.
03 Upon return to full gravity after a long period in zero G or low G, the character stands up and then passes out. (This “orthostatic intolerance” fades in a few hours.)
04 Vision becomes distorted because the character’s eyes literally take on a new shape in zero G, all vision-related tasks are hindered
05 Despite precautions, sometimes viruses infect a character. The common cold virus is, ridiculously enough, still not preventable in advanced settings, and if anything, has even more severe symptoms for those in microgravity. The character descends one step on the damage track until they get better.
06 The character is diagnosed with cancer. Depending on the tech setting, it is amenable to medical intervention (or at least long-term treatment to keep symptoms controlled), if that intervention comes soon enough.

OPTION TABLE MOVING IN MICROGRAVITY GM INTRUSIONS
Long-term zero G is dangerous, but there are issues associated with moving around in microgravity. Those who have spent at least a little time in microgravity can move as part of a routine action. It’s only when something else distracting or dangerous is happening simultaneously that routine movements through a ship or station become potentially problematic.
01 A misjudged jump uses too much force and the character takes damage when they hit an unexpected bulkhead or other obstruction, or too little force, leaving them stranded in the middle of an open area
02 A misjudged jump in microgravity causes the character to strike an important control surface that sets off a secondary issue, causes the character to jump to a dangerous location, or causes their tether (apparently previously abraded) to snap and send them spiraling out into space.
03 A tool, weapon, or other piece of equipment—even one that should have a tether or magnetic clamp— dislodges and floats away.
04 A mishap causes the character to spin wildly, hindering all tasks by two steps from disorientation and nausea. Without outside aid, micro thrusters, or some other useful strategy, stopping a spin is difficult.
05 An ally accidentally jostles the character, and they are sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump.
06 When attempting to grab a resisting target or panicking ally, or after some kind unexpected shake or violent ship maneuver, the character is sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump.

OPTION TABLE WEAPON SYSTEM GM INTRUSIONS 
A spacecraft may have more than one weapon system. Each individual weapon system has its own station, which can be crewed by a separate PC. Spacecraft systems are considered heavy weapons (which means some characters may be practiced in their use, though others may have an inability). A spacecraft can potentially make as many attacks each round as weapon systems it possesses, if each station is crewed. 
01 Weapon overheats, off-line next turn, unless quickly repaired.
02 Mistargeting, allied craft damaged, hindering its actions next turn.
03 Weapon malfunctions, requires repair before weapon can fire again.
04 Weapon station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair.
05 Weapon malfunctions, station pulses with electrical feedback damaging everyone on bridge. Requires repair.
06 Weapon melts to slag, must be replaced at a shipyard.

OPTION TABLE PILOTING SYSTEM GM INTRUSIONS
Many spacecraft have only a single system and dedicated station for piloting and navigation, suitable for a single PC to crew, though a larger craft could split those duties. A PC piloting a ship during combat can attempt any number of piloting tasks, as well as any other type of flying that they deem necessary. While not in combat, the PC crewing this station pilots the ship from place to place in space. 
01 Starcraft drive stutters, off-line next turn, unless quickly repaired.
02 Miscalculated flight vector occludes or disrupts allied craft, hindering its actions next turn.
03 Drive malfunction requires repair before drive will function again.
04 Piloting station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair
05 Unexpected thrust exposes everyone on ship to a moment of extreme Gs, inflicting damage on everyone. Secondary systems may require repair.
06 Drive will imminently die, must be replaced at a shipyard (though it can be nursed to life just a little longer with some redline engineering).

OPTION TABLE SCIENCE & ENGINEERING SYSTEM GM INTRUSIONS
A spacecraft may have more than one science and engineering system. Each science and engineering system has a station, each of which can be crewed by a separate PC. A spacecraft can potentially attempt as many science and engineering tasks each round as stations systems it possesses, if each one is crewed. 
01 Shields (or basic hull integrity) compromised, all ship defense tasks hindered this round.
02 Sensors compromised, all spacecraft tasks hindered this round.
03 Shields (or basic hull integrity) seriously compromised, all ship defense tasks hindered until repair is completed.
04 Station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair until station will function again.
05 Sensors seriously compromised, hindering all piloting and weapons task by two steps until repaired.
06 Hull integrity breached, atmosphere begins to vent, and possibly one or two crew too near the hole are at risk of being sucked out. Unless repaired, ship atmosphere is lost to space within a few minutes. 

OPTION TABLE WHEELED VEHICLE GM INTRUSIONS
01 Vehicle runs out of fuel or power.
02 Unexpected obstacle threatens to cause a crash.
03 Unexpected gap or loss of power requires rider to “jump” between stable surfaces by launching off a suitable ramp-like incline.
04 Another vehicle swerves into PC’s vehicle
05 Loose sand/gravel/particles/ice on surface threaten to cause a wipeout.
06 Too much velocity going around a corner threatens to cause a wipeout or crash.
07 Vehicle takes damage and threatens to detonate its power source.
08 Another vehicle hits PC’s vehicle from behind.
09 Vehicle’s brakes freezes.
10 Vehicle’s tire unexpectedly blows out.

OPTION TABLE HOVERING AND FLYING VEHICLE GM INTRUSIONS
01 Vehicle runs out of fuel or power (but not inflight).
02 Extreme turbulence threatens to cause a loss of control inflight
03 A glitch in the flight control—or pilot error—causes vehicle to bank too sharply, threatening a crash.
04 Unexpected debris/birds or other flying creatures impact the vehicle, damaging it. 
05 Landing gear is damaged, making eventual landing problematic.
06 Unexpectedly tall terrain feature threatens imminent collision.
07 Vehicle takes damage and threatens to detonate its power source
08 Another flying vehicle hits PC’s vehicle from above.
09 Vehicle runs out of fuel or power while inflight
10 Breach in airframe risks sucking pilot or passengers out to a long fall.

OPTION TABLE SEACRAFT GM INTRUSIONS
01 Vehicle begins taking on water due to minor leak.
02 Vehicle capsizes
03 Vehicle begins to sink due to major leak caused by structural flaw.
04 Vehicle collides with marine life/debris on water or other watercraft impacts the vehicle, damaging it. 
05 Power source unexpectedly dies.
06 Unmapped underwater terrain feature threatens/causes imminent collision.
07 Vehicle takes damage and threatens to detonate its power source.
08 Sea storm blows up and threatens to capsize vehicle.
09 Character(s) fall overboard.
10 Pirates! (Or at least people with bad intentions pull up on another boat.)

OPTION TABLE SPACECRAFT GM INTRUSIONS
01 Spacecraft is holed by micrometeorite or other debris and begins to leak air
02 Spacecraft power source unexpectedly stutters, runs out of fuel, or malfunctions in a way that could lead to detonation.
03 Spacecraft is holed by something large enough to risk a catastrophic blow-out.
04 Environmental controls malfunction; ship interior grows colder and colder (causing a buildup of frost and ice on interior surfaces), until the problem can be identified and repaired.
05 Drive system surges, causing the vehicle to move faster, farther, or to a different location than was intended.
06 Solar flare, gravitational gradient, or other understood but unexpected phenomena damages ship.
07 A malfunction, deliberate sabotage by a rival, or a fatal malware-infected shipmind affects the environmental controls in a space suit or entire ship, deoxygenating it until it’s mostly carbon dioxide. Affected characters, initially unaware of the problem, become more and more sleepy until they pass out.
08 Gamma ray burst from “nearby” neutron star conjunction threatens to fry ship and everyone on board.
09 External operations lead to a character being bucked off craft into empty space.
10 Environmental systems are compromised, requiring extensive overhaul to return to normal.

OPTION TABLE WORLD INTRUSIONS
1 One or more characters accidentally damage or offend a plant of some type, causing it to retaliate.
2 A wren starts singing at a nearby crossroads, warning that something’s coming.
3 One of the characters trips and falls into a rabbit hole.
4 Someone steals the moon just as the PCs are about to do an important task that requires moonlight.
5 The tree that the characters are sitting under wakes up. Perhaps it is hungry, or maybe it just wants company.
6 The path that the characters have been following turns into a rushing river beneath their feet.
7 Someone casting a curse nearby accidentally catches one of the characters in the magic, causing them to be affected (roll on the Curse table to determine the effect).
8 A mountain rises up suddenly between the place where the characters stand and the place they need to get to.
9 Somewhere far off, a magical effect backfires, causing a stampede of wild animals to run right toward the characters.
10 One of the characters smells gingerbread. The scent is so tempting, they have a hard time turning away from it.

OPTION TABLE ITEM INTRUSIONS
1 A magical ability, cypher, or artifact does exactly what it’s supposed to, but also creates a weird side effect that affects a nearby friend (or foe).
2 A piece of equipment whispers lies into the character’s ear, making a convincing argument that their friends are not loyal.
3 A magical weapon breaks in
the middle of combat and starts to cry.
4 A character’s belt turns into a snake and starts tightening around their middle.
5 A random object begins to wiggle and crack, as though it’s about
to hatch.
6 The character’s weapon or armor begins to yell loudly for help while the PC is trying to sneak or hide.
7 A previously opened box, bottle, jar, or other container has locked itself back up, with an important item inside.
8 A cypher, artifact, or bit of magic is far more powerful than the characters realized, and affects a much larger area (or has a bigger effect) than they expected it to.
9 The glint of a recently acquired object or weapon is so shiny, it attracts the attention of a giant bird, beast, or dragon.
10 An item in the character’s hand or bag starts to replicate itself over and over.

OPTION TABLE GENERAL HORROR GM INTRUSIONS
1 Something foils a character's attempt to escape: a getaway car won't start, they drop the keys that unlock the exit door or lock up the villain, or the shotgun they're using to clear a path jams or runs out of shells.
2 The antagonist enters a secure or sealed room by an unexpected method: crashing through a door or wall, crawling out of a ventilation shaft, jumping out of a trap door, manifesting electronically through a Wi-Fi signal, or teleporting.
3 A mysterious noise nearby amplifies the tension, and when investigated reveals itself to be … a cat, either perfectly calm or hissing and leaping. This often allows for a momentary de-escalation followed by a real scare, such as the antagonist reaching out of the darkness to grab a character.
4 A dramatic and/or ridiculous amount of blood and gore from something that just got killed splashes on a character, blinding them until they take an action to wipe their eyes clean.

OPTION TABLE ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH GM INTRUSIONS 
Unless the advanced device detonates or is otherwise noted as becoming nonfunctional, PCs with the time can try to understand how to use it again after resolving the intrusion.
1 Ooze sprays the character, then hardens, trapping them until they can escape a level 4 “shell.” 
2 Device becomes stuck in midair, immovable as if caught in invisible, otherwise intangible cement. 
3 Device grows increasingly hot over the course of one minute, then fuses into a nonfunctional lump. 
4 Device shoots like a bullet in a random direction for a long distance, lodging itself in a structure or tree. 
5 Very bright light flashes from the device, blinding the PC for a few minutes. 
6 A blue light on the device begins flashing; if device is not destroyed, an alien enthraller investigates. 
7 Device function is triggered, as are any other devices (cyphers and/or artifacts) the PC carries. 
8 Mutagenic energy pulse; character develops a distinctive mutation over the course of ten hours. 
9 Device breaks in half (becoming nonfunctional) and spills some sort of grey goo on the character. 
10 Device detonates, inflicting damage equal to its level on everything within short range on a failed Speed defense roll, or 2 points of damage even with a successful roll. 

NAMED OPTION TABLE REALISTIC THREATS AND HAZARDS
01-03 Blocked road: The road ahead is so filled with abandoned, rusted before‑times vehicles that the PCs must walk if they want to take that route. Walkers are unable to see more than an immediate distance in any direction between the cars. If PCs have a vehicle larger than a bicycle, they’ll have to find another way or leave it behind.
04-06 Setting‑specific element: Choose a hazard from a set piece or optional rule you’re using, or if you want to shake things up, roll on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table. Or just choose the next result on this table.
07-10 Angry ants (level 2): Thousands of biting ants pour from cracks in the pavement, attacking everything in an immediate area, inflicting 2 points of damage if they hit a target and, on a failed Might defense roll, dazing targets with pain for one round. Even if a target succeeds on its initial Speed defense roll, it takes 1 point of damage because the ants are everywhere.
11-14 Enraged wasps (level 3): This wasp swarm acts as a single level 3 creature whose stinging attacks ignore Armor. Attacks on the swarm that don’t deal area damage inflict only 1 point of damage.
15-17 Cannibal convoy: A before‑times RV pulls up. It’s the current property of a group of four to ten people who make the biofuel the vehicle runs on. They seem nice, but they’re actually cannibals thinking of inviting the PCs for dinner.
18-20 Earthquake, minor (level 3): The ground within long range of an epicenter heaves and shakes for one or more minutes. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage due to the general shaking on a failed Speed defense roll, or 6 points of damage if they are in or adjacent to a structure or terrain feature shedding debris on a failed Speed defense roll.
21-23 Radioactive crater (level 3): Inflicts 3 points of ambient damage per round and moves the character one step down the damage track each day they fail a difficulty 5 Might defense task.
24-26 Radioactive storm (level 3): Treat as a radioactive crater, but one that moves.
27-29 Exposed electrical wiring, minor (level 3): Inflicts 3 points of damage per round of contact, and the character is stunned and unable to take their next action until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Might defense task.
30-33 Dilapidated infrastructure, minor (level 3): The floor gives way beneath a character who falls 30 feet (9 m) on a failed Speed defense roll, taking 3 points of ambient damage and moving one step down the damage track.
34-40 Poisoned waters, minor (level 3): Whether it’s water flooding a structure, a stream, a swamp, or a lake, drinking it inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 1 point of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task.
41-48 Bridge, dangerous (level 4+): PCs on an overpass, train trestle, or other bridge must make a Speed defense roll as a section gives way beneath their feet, potentially dropping them 40 to 200 feet (12 to 60 m).
49-53 Burning structure (level 4): Everything in or within immediate range of this fire takes 4 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. If PCs can’t get away, choking smoke in the area means they must succeed on Might defense rolls each round or suffer 2 points of ambient damage and lose their next action.
54-57 Choking pollution (level 4): Asbestos and other substances once safely bound up in the infrastructure are loose, sometimes as clouds of dangerous particulate matter inflicting 4 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll.
58-67 Raider patrol: Whether on scavenged trucks or motorcycles, or riding mutant pigs bred as war mounts (war pigs), a group of three to six fell riders is bad news.
68-72 Avalanche (level 5): A rumble precedes the falling snow as an avalanche of snow threatens to bury the PCs. (The avalanche could be debris or rubble instead of snow.)
73-75 Dilapidated infrastructure, major (level 5): The building, underpass tunnel, or cave collapses, or the bridge over which the vehicle is passing crumbles. Characters suffer 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 5 Speed task are buried under suffocating rubble until they can escape or are rescued. For additional danger, treat as an unstable structure.
76-78 Disease (level 5+): Even if the world didn’t end because of a pandemic, disease threatens the PCs when they meet a group of especially unlucky (and diseased) survivors.
79-80 Flooded region (level 5): A failed Speed defense roll means the rushing waters envelop the character, inflicting 5 points of damage and moving them a short distance in the direction of the water’s flow. A serious flood could further endanger the character.
81 Firenado (level 5): Fire generates a vortex of flame and smoke, creating a rotating column of air that draws in flames and debris, resulting in a powerful whirlwind of fire. The vortex moves an immediate distance (on a roll of 1–3 on a d6) or a short distance (on a roll of 4–6 on a d6) each round in a random direction, persisting for 1d6 + 2 rounds before dispersing. Anyone intersected by the firenado’s immediate‑radius area takes 5 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. The PC must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled up into the firenado, burned for another 5 points of damage, and hurled in a random direction a short distance, which inflicts another 5 points of damage from falling and/or impacting other structures. 82-84 Poisoned waters, major (level 5): Drinking this slightly glowing water inflicts 5 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task.
85-86 Just a bear, but a big one: A regular grizzly bear is always frightening, before or after the end. Grizzly bear: level 5; health 20; Armor 1 * War pig: level 3; rider has asset on melee attacks, or pig can make a separate tusk attack when rider attacks
87-88 Nuclear fallout (level 5): Radioactive dust drifts to the ground or precipitates out as rain. PCs in the area suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute, and if they remain for an hour or longer, they’re subject to radiation sickness.
89-91 Toxic spill (level 5): Sticky orange goo bursts from rusted ancient barrels. Characters who fail a Speed defense task are caught and held in place until they can escape the morass, taking 5 points of damage each round they remain stuck.
92-94 Unexploded ordnance (level 5): A buried land mine inflicts 5 points of damage to everything within short range if trod upon or otherwise set off.
95-97 Superstorm (level 6): With the climate destabilized, storms of unprecedented strength sometimes blow, creating winds that inflict 6 points of damage each round targets are exposed.
98-99 Radiation, extreme (level 8): This area was recently hit by a nuclear bomb or other extreme radioactive event, and those in the area for more than a minute who fail a Might defense roll suffer from radiation sickness.
00 Unexploded nuclear warhead (level 10): If not defused, it could kill everything in a several‑mile radius and is likely radioactive to boot.

NAMED OPTION TABLE FANTASTIC THREATS AND HAZARDS
1 Hallucinatory flowers (level 3): The ground floor of the ruin hosts a handful of purplish flowers growing up out of the rubble. A character who gets a puff of the pollen hallucinates their allies are actually cannibals trying to eat the affected character each round until the character succeeds on a Might defense roll.
2 AI instance, minor (level 3): An artificial intelligence in an old facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.
3-4 Voracious cockroach swarm (level 3): This swarm, easily covering an area a short distance in diameter, doesn’t shrink from the light or from people. Indeed, it seems eerily intelligent, and if threatened, it attacks, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on everything in its area that fails a Speed defense roll, or 1 point on a successful roll.
5 Animate vegetation (level 4): Kudzu got a lot worse in the aftermath. Characters that fail a Speed defense roll take 4 points of damage each round from strangulation and vine constriction until they can escape
6 Ashy tide (level 4): A series of powerful wind gusts in the area kicks up a lot of fine grey ash. Except it’s not ash—it’s a collection of nanobots, each the size of a grain of sand or smaller, called ashy tide.
7-8 Glowing roach infestation: Four to ten glowing roaches the size of dogs have truly come into their own now that they’ve grown in stature and intelligence. They have little use for survivors, except as food.
9 Psychic lichen (level 4): Psychic lichen gently attacks the minds of nearby creatures, causing them to grow tired and nap if they fail an Intellect defense roll. If not awakened, the dozing body serves as food for a new psychic lichen colony.
10 Strike from the heavens (level 4): A before‑times war satellite becomes active and fires a focused microwave beam at the PCs in the area, inflicting 4 points of damage each round they remain in the area without solid cover and fail a Might defense roll, or 2 points on a successful roll.
11 Abomination lair: The abomination was a person once, or its ancestors were. Not anymore.
12 Fiery fissure (level 5): A crack splinters the ground along a newly forming fire‑filled fissure that stretches a long distance, zigging and zagging to catch several more targets than it might otherwise. PCs who fail a Speed defense roll fall in and are burned for 5 points of damage each round until they can climb out or be pulled out with a successful Might task as an action.
13 Glowing tide (level 5): Veins of yellow‑gold light branching across surfaces (roads, buildings, and bare earth) indicate that nanites are probably active, creating a dangerous area of glowing tide.
14 Time anomaly (level 5): The PCs encounter a wall of golden light whose interior ripples with lightning. It’s a time storm, and either it blocks the PCs’ path, or worse, it’s gradually sweeping toward the characters.
15 AI instance, major (level 6): An artificial intelligence in a powered facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI (because an instance of the AI is running in their head). A target can make a new Intellect defense roll each day to try to reject the control. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.
16 Hungry tide (level 6): A greyish‑green mist of nanobots a short distance in diameter drifts in the wind, until the hungry tide senses living organisms and moves a short distance each round toward them.
17 Quantum singularity (level 6): Attempts to change the past to avert the apocalypse have consequences, including these points of unstable space‑time. Characters who fail an Intellect defense task are teleported a short distance in a random direction and possibly several hours forward in time.
18-19 Rampaging wardroid (level 6): Wardroids may be what caused the apocalypse in the first place; whatever the case, one has wandered directly into the PCs’ path.
20 Mutant bear: The house‑sized radioactive bear, whose roar can be heard for miles, is something to avoid.

OPTION TABLE GM INTRUSIONS FOR POST-APOCALYPTIC GAMES
If you’re running a game set in the ruins following civilization’s fall, refer to the following list of unexpected complications to your PCs’ day. GM intrusions can happen anytime, whether the PCs think they’re safe in a defended settlement or recently secured shelter, or traveling across the wasteland.
01–02 (group): Roll on the preceding Realistic Threats and Hazards table, or on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table if your game includes fantastic elements.
03–04: The character is surprised by a diseased feral cat, which bites them and runs off, infecting the PC with a level 4 disease that drops them one step on the damage track each day they fail a Might defense roll.
05–06 (group or character): The PCs’ mode of transport breaks (or someone’s boot heel snaps off), requiring about an hour of repair, possibly meaning that they have to duck into nearby ruins to find parts.
07–08: A weirdly gnarled hand emerges from the ground or ruin, grabs the character, and pulls them down into an ancient bunker containing a zombie hulk.
09–10 (group): The PCs discover their food and water supplies have become contaminated with poisonous mold or dangerous levels of radiation (level 4).
11–12 (group): An unseasonal blizzard forces the PCs to seek shelter in an abandoned train yard, which shows signs of being claimed by another group of survivors.
13–14: The character treads on a sticky slurry of ooze leaking from a ruined factory that holds them in place unless they give up their footwear and/or succeed on a difficulty 5 Might task to pull free.
15–16: A radioactive spider bites the character, inflicting 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), and on a failed difficulty 3 Might defense roll, the character develops one harmful mutation. Each day the PC can attempt another Might defense roll; with a success, the mutation subsides.
17–18 (group): A wildfire or structural fire (level 5) moves through the area; PCs must run before it to survive. However, when the fire has burnt out several hours later, the PCs are lost.
19–20 (group): A sinkhole opens beneath the PCs’ vehicle, which becomes hopelessly stuck in loose earth until they can succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to push it out. If PCs don’t have a vehicle, the sinkhole sucks down one character and threatens to smother them unless the others succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to extract them.
21–22: The PC discovers they are infested with mutant green lice (level 5); Might tasks (including defense rolls) are hindered until the PC is treated with appropriate cleansing chemicals.
23–24 (group): High winds, acidic precipitation, or a drift of grey goo eats through the PCs’ shelter’s roof.
25–26: The character wakes to discover that some of their equipment has been pilfered, but the PC on watch didn’t see anything (and isn’t responsible for the theft). Investigation reveals that weirdly smart termites (level 4) working together made off with the item.
27–28 (group): Yellow mushrooms with black speckles (level 4) grow profusely in the area and ooze weirdly blood‑like fluid when brushed or trod upon, or simply as PCs pass by. The mushrooms are poisonous, inflicting 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if ingested, but they also grant PCs a one‑time asset on any knowledge tasks they attempt during the next ten hours.
29–30 (group): That buzzing noise that’s been getting louder and louder is revealed as a swarm of aggressive, stinging radioactive bees. Radioactive bees, swarm: level 5; stings inflict 6 damage and, on failed Might defense roll, an allergic reaction dealing 1 Speed damage (ignores Armor) each minute until target is tended
31–32 (group): The PCs enter a region threatened by pockets of explosive gas (level 5), visible before they detonate as low‑lying banks of thin, yellowish mist. If agitated, a gas pocket detonates, inflicting 5 points of damage on everything in the area, or 2 points on PCs who succeed on a Speed defense roll.
33–34: The character trips or is thrown from their vehicle or mount by a jolt or similar accidental incident, risking a broken bone on a failed difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.
35–36 (group): A before‑times radio transmission is received, asking anyone, anywhere, for aid.
37–38 (group): Mosquitos the size of hummingbirds attack. Mosquitos, giant, swarm: level 3; bite inflicts damage and, on failed Might defense roll, target contracts Nipah 
39–40: The character steps in a bear trap left by other survivors. The PC takes 6 points of damage and is caught in a painful clamp until an ally succeeds on a difficulty 6 Might task to remove it.
41–42: The character stumbles over a decaying human corpse apparently killed by invasive fungus (level 3) eating through their brain.
43–44: The character ate something that didn’t agree with them, and becomes so afflicted with nausea that their tasks, attacks, and defense rolls are hindered by two steps for the next few hours.
45–46 (group): A mushroom cloud from a nuclear detonation blooms on the horizon. Are the PCs far enough away to survive? Maybe, if they find shelter pronto.
47–48: A mutated animal with unhealthy skin lesions and bulbous growths (with giant rat stats) scurries from the character’s backpack or other container when they stow or retrieve equipment. The animal runs off unless attacked, in which case it fights to the death.
49–50 (group): The PCs encounter a survivor claiming to be looking for a source of water that’s not radioactive. Maybe they’re telling the truth and could use some help. Or maybe they’re a spy from a nearby raider camp.
51–52: The thin trickle of water running through the ruins must be intermittently in contact with live electrical wires, as the character discovers when they take 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are stunned, losing their next turn.
53–54: A lurking rattlesnake bites the PC, then slithers off.
55–56 (group): When the PCs return to their camp or place of refuge, they find that someone else has stolen all their carefully hoarded stores and wrecked part of the camp.
57–58 (group): A pack of seven rabid dogs appears, growling and snarling. Rabid dog: level 3, attacks as level 4; Armor 1 59–60: The character falls partly (or completely) through the rotting floor, trapping their foot until they succeed on a difficulty 4 Might roll, or dropping them to a lower floor (and separating them from the others).
61–62 (group): It’s hot outside today, due to a combination of aberrant weather conditions. PCs without some means of cooling themselves off suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute in the “heat dome” covering the region.
63–64 (group): Eroded earth and dead vegetation in the region create perfect conditions for a sandstorm, which blows through the area for several hours, reducing visibility to an immediate distance.
65–66 (group): An electromagnetic storm rips through the area, knocking out any electronic devices the PCs might have, and potentially threatening PCs without shelter with a lightning strike (level 7).
67–68: An automatic defense system comes back online as PCs pass, deploying a metal‑clad pop‑up turret (level 5). Each minute, it targets the character with a mini‑missile attack that inflicts 10 points of damage (or 3 points even with a successful Speed defense roll).
69–70 (group): A group of three to six zombies (or cannibals, if your game has no zombies) stumbles out of the hospital, bunker, or old military facility.
71–72: The character’s trusty weapon finally rusts through or otherwise breaks.
73–74 (group): Seeping gas (level 4) in the area causes the PCs to begin hallucinating. Each is certain the other is some kind of threat—such as a raider, a zombie, or something else dangerous—until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll on their turn to realize what’s going on.
75–76 (group): The characters are caught in a stampede of rewilded giraffes, elephants, buffalo, or other large animals. Each PC suffers 3 points of damage, descends one step on the damage track, and on a failed difficulty 3 Speed defense roll, is borne along for a while and separated from their allies.
77–78 (group): The heavy rain and lightning storm suddenly births a tornado. PCs must seek shelter or suffer 7 points of damage each round they are exposed. If a PC takes enough damage to descend three steps on the damage track, they are pulled up into the vortex and lost.
79–80: The character discovers they’ve started growing a sixth finger on their left hand. Why? Maybe due to their previous exposures to whatever mutagen exists in the world, or for a reason yet to be learned.
81–82 (group): A before‑times jet appears in the sky, engines spewing smoke, before it crashes close enough to deal 4 points of damage to PCs that fail a difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.
83–84 (group): It begins to hail ice chunks the size of golf balls, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on PCs without shelter. The event also knocks any exposed vehicles or shelter the PCs rely on one step down the object damage track.
85–86: The character steps on a plant that releases spores blinding them for about a minute.
87–88: The character walks through a hidden trip wire set by other survivors, causing an alarm to blare.
89–90 (group): A group of people (level 2) with glazed eyes appear with gifts of food. They want to introduce the PCs to their AI benefactor (or warlord, if your game has no AIs) via an old‑time communications device they have with them.
91–92: The character has been pushing too hard and they’re exhausted; they move down one step on the damage track until after their next ten‑hour recovery.
93–94: Through misadventure, the character falls from the vehicle or mount, and no one else immediately notices.
95–96: A mutant skunk with two heads (or regular skunk, if your game doesn’t feature mutations) sprays the character. The character’s pleasant social interaction tasks are hindered by two steps for two to five days.
97–98 (group): NPC survivors demand PCs pay a toll to pass, equal to enough food and water to sustain one person for five days.
99–00 (group): The PCs arrive, but apparently their directions were wrong, because they’re not where they wanted to go, but someplace completely different.

OPTION TABLE CURSE TABLE
Typically, curses that have simple roleplaying effects (such as the character’s inability to speak their own name) are lower-level curses, while those that affect gameplay (such as decreasing recovery roll points) are higher level. Curses that have multiple effects are likely the highest level of all. However, sometimes an incredibly simple curse is still very high level because the caster wants to make it very hard to get rid of.

3 Turned into a living object
4 Turned into a great beast

19 Can no longer say, write, or spell their own name
20 No one else remembers or recognizes the character

OPTION TABLE CURSE REMOVAL TABLE 
Some curses have a specific way that they must be removed. Others can be removed in a variety of ways. You can use the table as a reference for ways to remove or undo a curse, or you can roll 1d10 to give a curse a specific method of removal.
1 Complete an important task for the one who cursed you.
2 Complete an important task for (or make a large payment to) someone who promises to remove your curse.
3 Make things right (return the stolen item, apologize, or undo whatever was done to cause the curse to happen in the first place).
4 Write the name of the curse
on a scrap of paper, bind it in
a cloth with an egg, bury it at a crossroads, and never look back.
5 Pass the curse to someone else (this typically requires learning how the curse was done and then passing it to another person in the same way, but there are also more creative ways to make this happen).
6 Collect five birds, five beetles, five cats, five fish, and five young winds.
7 Die and return to life, which usually (but not always) takes advantage of a loophole that says death will end a curse.
8 Take three golden leaves from
a golden tree to make tea with; drink the tea and read the leaves; then complete the task they suggest.
9 Kill the one who cast the curse (or otherwise find a way for them to die).
10 Find a poem of which there is only one written copy, read it backward each morning for seven mornings in a row, and then burn the item upon which the poem is written.

OPTION TABLE FOCUS CONNECTIONS
1 Pick one other PC. For reasons unknown to you, that character is completely immune to your focus abilities, whether you use them for help or for harm.
2 Pick one other PC. You knew of that character years ago, but you don't think they knew you.
3 Pick one other PC. You're always trying to impress them, but you're not sure why. 
4 Pick one other PC. That character has a habit that annoys you, but you're otherwise quite impressed with their abilities.
5 Pick one other PC. That character shows potential in appreciating your particular paradigm, fighting style, or other focus-provided attribute. You would like to train them, but you're not necessarily qualified to teach (that's up to you), and they might not be interested (that's up to them).
6 Pick one other PC. If they are within immediate range when you're in a fight, sometimes they provide an asset, and sometimes they accidentally hinder your attack rolls (50% chance either way, determined per fight).
7 Pick one other PC. You once saved their life, and they clearly feel indebted to you. You wish they didn't; it's just part of the job.
8 Pick one other PC. That character recently mocked you in some fashion that really hurt your feelings. How you deal with this (if at all) is up to you.
9 Pick one other PC. That character knows you have suffered at the hands of robotic entities in the past. Whether you hate robots now is up to you, which may affect your relationship with the character if they are friendly with robots or have robotic parts.
10 Pick one other PC. That character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children.
11 Pick one other PC. In the past, they taught you a few tricks to use in a fight.
12 Pick one other PC. That character doesn't seem to approve of your methods.
13 Pick one other PC. Long ago, the two of you were on opposite sides of a fight. You won, though you “cheated” in their eyes (but from your perspective, all's fair in a fight). They may be ready for a rematch, though that's up to them.
14 Pick one other PC. You are always trying to impress that character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado. Perhaps they are a rival, perhaps you need their respect, or perhaps you're romantically interested in them.
15 Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities and worry that it might lead to problems.
16 Pick one other PC. You accidentally caught them in a trap you set, and they had to get free on their own.
17 Pick one other PC. You were once hired to track down someone who was close to that character.
18 Pick two PCs (preferably ones who are likely to get in the way of your attacks). When you miss with an attack and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target, you hit one of these two characters.
19 Pick one other PC. You're not sure how or from where, but that character has a line on bottles of rare alcohol and can get them for you for half price.
20 Pick one other PC. You recently had a possession go missing, and you're becoming convinced that they took it. Whether or not they did is up to them.
21 Pick one other PC. They always seem to know where you are, or at least in what direction you are in relation to them.
22 Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities seems to trigger an unpleasant memory in that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.
23 Pick one other PC. Something about them interferes with your abilities. When they stand next to you, your focus abilities cost 1 additional point.
24 Pick one other PC. Something about them complements your abilities. When they stand next to you, the first focus ability you use in any 24-hour period costs 2 fewer points.
25 Pick one other PC. You have known that character for a while, and they helped you gain control of your focus-related abilities.
26 Pick one other PC. Sometime in that character's past, they had a devastating experience while attempting something that you do as a matter of course thanks to your focus. Whether they choose to tell you about it is up to them.
27 Pick one other PC. Their occasional clumsiness and loud behavior irritate you.
28 Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while practicing, you accidentally hit them with an attack, wounding them badly. It is up to them to decide whether they resent or forgive you.
29 Pick one other PC. They owe you a significant amount of money.
30 Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while escaping a threat, you accidentally left that character to fend for themselves. They survived, but just barely. It is up to the player of that character to decide whether they resent you or have decided to forgive you.
31 Pick one other PC. Recently, they accidentally (or perhaps intentionally) put you in a position of danger. You're fine now, but you're wary around them.
32 Pick one other PC. From your perspective, they seem nervous around a specific idea, person, or situation. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their fears (if they will let you).
33 Pick one other PC. They called you a coward once.
34 Pick one other PC. That character always recognizes you or your handiwork, whether you're in disguise or are long gone when they arrive on the scene. 
35 Pick one other PC. You inadvertently caused an accident that put them into a sleep so deep they didn't wake for three days. Whether they forgive you or not is up to them.
36 Pick one other PC. You are pretty sure you are related in some fashion.
37 Pick one other PC. You accidentally learned something they were trying to keep a secret.
38 Pick one other PC. They are especially sensitive to the use of your flashier focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazzled for a few rounds, which hinders their actions.
39 Pick one other PC. They appear to have a treasured item that was once yours, but that you lost in a game of chance years ago.
40 Pick one other PC. If it wasn't for you, that character would have failed a past test of mental achievement.
41 Pick one other PC. Based on a couple of comments you've overheard, you suspect that they don't hold your area of training or favorite hobby in the highest regard.
42 Pick one other PC whose focus intertwines with yours. This odd connection affects them in some way. For example, if the character uses a weapon, your focus ability sometimes improves their attack in some fashion.
43 Pick one other PC. They are deathly afraid of heights. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their feet off the ground. They must decide whether or not to take you up on your offer.
44 Pick one other PC. They are skeptical of your claims about something momentous that happened in your past. They might even attempt to discredit you or discover the “secret” behind your story, though that's up to them.
45 Pick one other PC. They have a knack for being able to recognize where your plans or schemes have a weak spot.
46 Pick one other PC. That character's face is so intriguing to you in a way you don't understand that you sometimes find yourself sketching their likeness in the dirt or using some other medium you have access to.
47 Pick one other PC. That character has an extra item of regular equipment you gave them, either something you made or an item you just wanted to give them. (They choose the item.)
48 Pick one other PC. They commissioned you to do a job for them. You've already been paid but haven't yet completed the job.
49 Pick one other PC. You worked together in the past, and the job ended badly.
50 Pick one other PC. While they stand next to you and use their action to concentrate on helping you, one of your focus ability's ranges is doubled.
