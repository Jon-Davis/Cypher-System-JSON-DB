Serums of all types are generally dispensed from an autodoc, but may also be obtained as individual units, or in packs or cases. An ampule of remedial serum grants the user 3 points they can add to any Pool. It also has the benefit of relieving hangover symptoms. 

Serum, space-fit; level 4 (12); Moderate; As remedial serum, but protects against the two most common dangers to human physiology from extended trips into space and long-term exposure to zero G and radiation, which most notably include DNA breakage from cosmic rays and bone and muscle deterioration from microgravity. An ampule of space-fit serum lasts for about a month.

Serum, acceleration; level 4 (12); Expensive; As remedial serum, but allows user to ignore the many deleterious physiological effects of acceleration and high-G maneuvers (of up to 15 Gs) for one hour (or of up to 20 Gs for a few minutes). Users are likely unable to move under high G, but won’t pass out, have a stroke, cardiac arrest, etc.—at least, not immediately. Prolonged use may still lead to all these outcomes.

ADVANCED; ROBOTS & AI
Auton; level 1 (3); Moderate; The generic term “auton” refers to a smart robot, one able to exist in the world as a full-fledged entity, though not nearly so competent as a true AI. On the other hand, autons come very close to having self-awareness, and some have probably achieved it. The variety of autons is staggering, given that they can be trained in nearly any task. Autons also come in a variety of shapes and colors, which vary based on culture and tech level. Though most can move on treads or legs to follow their owners as directed, some autons are housed in drone-like chassis using either rotors or microthrusters, allowing them to fly rather than move on the ground. Treat a basic auton as a level 1 follower, which allows the auton modifications in one task. 

Auton, aide; level 2 (6); Expensive; Treat as a level 2 follower, which allows the auton modifications in up to two tasks, depending on the particular aide. 

Auton, medical; level 2 (6); Exorbitant; As auton, but one modification is always healing. A medical auton also incorporates a mobile autodoc.

Auton, warrior; level 2 (6); Exorbitant;  As auton, but one modification is always in attacks, which means when helping a target to make an attack, the target eases the task by two steps. However, warrior autons usually attack autonomously as level 3 entities with a ranged or melee weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage. 

Shipmind; level 3 (9); Exorbitant x2; A shipmind is a sim AI that exists within a single spacecraft or starship, with the ability to control many aspects of vehicle functions as necessary to supplement a crew, or sometimes in lieu of a crew. Shipminds each have their own simulated personality, emulating consciousness, though in most cases, they are not actually conscious. Having a shipmind installed on a spacecraft is immensely helpful, as it can oversee many basic functions. A shipmind usually accomplishes tasks at the level of the ship in which it is installed.

FANTASTIC; ROBOTS & AI
Synth; level 3 (9); Expensive Synths are a blend of biological and mechanical parts so advanced that in some cases it’s impossible to tell the difference between a living creature and a synth. They are strong AIs in physical bodies. Other varieties of synths are constructed (or have modified themselves) to make it obvious they are not biological. In any case, synths are often sturdier and longer lasting than an average biological entity. Even so, in some settings, synths are relegated to being servitors, as if they were simple robots and autons. In other settings, a few, some, or all humans have long ago migrated into synth bodies, leaving their biology behind in prehistory, and becoming posthuman. Treat as a level 3 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up to three tasks, depending on the particular synth. At minimum, all synths have 2 Armor and regain 1 point of lost health per round if damaged.

Cargo starships may be impressively massive, or at least haul cargo sections that are quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered. 

Starship, solo fighter; level 2 (6); Exorbitant; A small double-occupant starship with two weapon systems that fire blasters. Minimum size vehicle capable of FTL travel. 

Starship, general purpose; level 3 (9); Exorbitant; A small starship with room for only three to six crew plus an integrated ship AI able to handle many routine ship functions including navigation with FTL propulsion system. Designed for exploration of distant locations, salvage operations, and/or to act as a tug-craft for larger ships that need assistance. May possess a single weapon system such as a particle cannon. 

Starship, discovery class; level 5 (15); Priceless; A large research starship with quarters for crew and staff of up to 150 or more people. Has either centrifugal artificial gravity (or in a fantastic tech-rated setting, gravitic compensators providing shipboard gravity control). Primarily designed as a research and discovery vehicle, such starships also have three weapon systems, usually a couple of blaster cannons and a torpedo battery. Highly configurable, a discovery class ship could be converted for war with sufficient resources, granting it superior weapons. 

Starship, warship class; level 5 (15); Priceless; A relatively small warship with gravitic compensators allowing for extreme maneuvering for a crew of up to fifty people, easing all piloting tasks. Six weapon stations include three blaster cannons and three torpedo batteries. Two of these systems are superior weapons. Includes bays for a fireteam of three dagger fighter starships.

Starship, capital class; level 7 (21); Priceless; As warship class starship, but over a hundred times larger, with room for over a few hundred crew. Ten weapon stations include five blaster cannons and five torpedo batteries. Four of these are superior weapons. Includes bays for two squadrons of fifteen dagger fighter starships. 

Starship, omega class; level 10 (30); Priceless; Three times as large again as a capital class starship, an omega class craft has over a thousand crew and over thirty weapon systems. Ten of these are superior weapons. Combined weapon fire can deal significant damage to a planetary surface, possibly destroying it. Includes bays for six squadrons of thirty dagger fighter starships.

FANTASTIC; STELLAR GATE
Gate, planetary; level 3 (9); Priceless; A free-standing ring or horizontal circular pad up to 9 m (30 feet) in diameter in/over which a spherical event horizon forms, allowing one-way travel to another location on the planet, orbiting moon, or orbiting space station with similar gate structure. Once the event horizon collapses (after several minutes up to an hour), travel back to the original gate is possible by initiating a second event horizon, though power reserves usually take several hours or more to build up to support each new wormhole opening. 

Gate, interplanetary; level 4 (12); Priceless; As planetary gate, but twice as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a single solar system. 

Gate, star; level 5 (15); Priceless; As planetary gate, but four times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a few thousand light-years. 

Gate, galactic; level 6 (18); Priceless; As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a single galaxy. 

Gate, intergalactic; level 7 (21); Priceless; As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations in different galaxies across the entire breadth of the universe. 

Gate, interdimensional; level 7 (21); Priceless; As planetary gate, but connects gate structures that lie in alternate dimensions.

FANTASTIC; SPACE-TIME VEHICLES
Car, temporal/dimensional; level 7 (21); Priceless; As contemporary utility car or sports car, but once moving can transition into another preset dimension or time. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use. 

Matrix, temporal; level 8 (24); Priceless; An arbitrarily shaped vehicle or structure, bigger on the inside than out, that allows a pilot to travel into different locations in time and space, though arbitrary destinations are sometimes achieved despite apparent navigation successes by the pilot. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use.
