WARRIOR

PLAYER INTRUSIONS
Perfect Setup: You're fighting at least three foes and each one is standing in exactly the right spot for you to use a move you trained in long ago, allowing you to attack all three as a single action. Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action.
Old Friend: A comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and provides aid in whatever you're doing. They are on a mission of their own and can't stay longer than it takes to help out, chat for a while after, and perhaps share a quick meal.
Weapon Break: Your foe's weapon has a weak spot. In the course of the combat, it quickly becomes damaged and moves two steps down the object damage track.

ADEPT

PLAYER INTRUSIONS
Advantageous Malfunction: A device being used against you malfunctions. It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.
Convenient Idea: A flash of insight provides you with a clear answer or suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you're facing.
Inexplicably Unbroken: An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution, alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.

PLAYER INTRUSIONS
Fortuitous Malfunction: A trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before it can affect you.

SPEAKER

PLAYER INTRUSIONS
Friendly NPC: An NPC you don't know, someone you don't know that well, or someone you know but who hasn't been particularly friendly in the past chooses to help you, though doesn't necessarily explain why. Maybe they'll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much trouble they go to.
Perfect Suggestion: A follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you're facing.
Unexpected Gift: An NPC hands you a physical gift you were not expecting, one that helps put the situation at ease if things seem strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the context of the situation if there's something you're failing to understand or grasp.

Intellect 11

BACKGROUND
1 One of your parents was a famous entertainer in their early years and hoped you would excel in the same medium.
2 When you were a teenager, one of your siblings went missing and is presumed dead. The shock rent your family, and it’s something you’ve never gotten over.
3 You were inducted into a secret society that claims to hold and protect esoteric knowledge opposing the forces of evil.
4 You lost one of your parents to alcoholism. They may still be alive, but you’d be hard pressed to find forgiveness.
5 You have no memory of anything that happened to you before the age of 18.
6 Your grandparents raised you on a farm far from bustling urban centers. You like to think the instruction they gave you prepared you for anything.
7 As an orphan, you had a difficult childhood, and your entry into adulthood was challenging.
8 You grew up in extreme poverty, among criminals. You still have some connections with the old neighborhood.
9 You served as an envoy for a powerful and influential person in the past, and they still look upon you with favor.
10 You have an annoying rival who always seems to get in your way or foil your plans.
11 You’ve worked yourself into the position of spokesperson for an organization or company of some importance.
12 Your neighbors were murdered, and the mystery remains unsolved.
13 You have traveled extensively, and during that time you accumulated quite a collection of strange souvenirs.
14 Your childhood sweetheart ended up with your best friend (now your ex-best friend).
15 You are part of a maligned minority, but you work to bring the injustice of your status to public attention.
16 You’re part owner of a local bar, where you’re something of a whiz in creating specialty cocktails.
17 You once ran a con that cheated important people out of money, and they want revenge. 
18 You used to act in a traveling theater, and they remember you fondly (as do people in the places you visited).
19 You are in a close romantic relationship with someone in local politics.
20 Someone out there tries to pose as you, using your identity, often for nefarious ends. You’ve never met the culprit, but you’d certainly like to.
