It only causes pain, and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within a day.\nRunning water: Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain all health lost in this way.\nHoly water: This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire exactly like fire.\nSunlight: Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within a day.\nWooden stake: This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively destroying the vampire in one blow.

If two or more guards attack the same target with at least one melee attack in the same round, the target's Speed defense roll against those attacks is hindered.\nInteraction: Interacting with a guard typically involves one issue: does the PC want to do something that the guard has been told to prevent? If so, the PC could have a difficult time. \nUse: To the PCs, guards can be allies, obstacles, or both. Guards who serve the public good have their own duties and aren't interested in doing the characters' work for them.\nLoot: A guard has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item in addition to weapons, armor, and basic gear.\nGM intrusion: 1d6 local citizens intervene on the guard's behalf, calling for more guards or even fighting the guard's foes.\n\n\n\nOCCULTIST\t5 (15)\nParanormal researchers, cultists, secret practitioners of white magic, and coven members might be occultists. Thanks to their study of the metaphysical, occultists learn several magical tricks, including the ability to summon or banish the dead.\nHealth: 15\nDamage Inflicted: 5 points\nMovement: Short\nModifications: Knowledge of occult topics and rituals as level 8; ability to detect lies and tricks as level 2\nCombat: An occultist has a charm or device for summoning a level 5 spirit or demon that will do their bidding for ten minutes. Some also have (or instead have) a spell, item, or device that inflicts 5 points of damage on normal creatures within long range, and 10 points of damage on a demon or spirit (or, instead of dealing extra damage, the effect confines the demon or spirit in some way).\nInteraction: Occultists are deeply concerned with spiritual or demonic matters and see those influences in all things, whether those influences exist or not. That makes them amenable to persuasion and deception, if couched in the language of spiritual influence.\nUse: To find a needed answer, the spirit of a dead person must be questioned. Alternatively, a haunting presence must be banished. Either way, the task requires an occultist.\nLoot: In addition to their clothing and mundane weapons, occultists have currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, a cypher, and possibly an artifact related to their power over spirits or demons.\nGM intrusion: A bony hand erupts from the ground at the character's feet. On a failed Speed defense roll, they are held in place until they succeed on a Might-based task to escape. Each round the character fails to escape, the hand squeezes for 3 points of damage.\n\n\nSECRET AGENT\t5 (15)\nSecret agents are trained professionals who put their mission before their own well-being, regardless of which government agency, corporation, guild, or kingdom employs them. An agent operates under a fake cover, perhaps as an envoy, inspector, technician, actor, tourist, or bumbling fool.","motive":"Accomplish the goals of the employer while maintaining cover","environment":null,"health":15,"damage":"5 points","armor":0,"movement":"Short","modifications":["Tasks related to disguise and deceiving as level 6"],"combat":"A secret agent always has a covert, unexpected backup weapon that they can use to make a surprise attack, such as a ring or glove with a hidden poisoned needle (dealing 5 points of Speed damage that ignore Armor), a fake tooth filled with poison gas to blow in a victim's face (inducing sleep for ten minutes), or a ring with a miniature gun.\n","interactions":"Secret agents are confident, masterful, and always give the impression of being one step ahead of the game, even when caught off guard.","uses":"As an ally, a secret agent can guide the PCs to their next mission, fill in gaps in their knowledge, and warn them of dangers. If the characters encounter an unfriendly agent, the NPC likely pretends to be a friend.","loot":"Agents typically have currency equivalent to an expensive item, a couple of cyphers, tools for spying and maintaining their cover, and possibly an artifact.","intrusions":"The secret agent produces a cypher that, for the rest of the day, eases all tasks by two steps."},{"name":"THUG","kind":"NPC","level":3,"description":"Thugs are usually rough, crude, and harsh individuals who prey on those who follow the rules. A thug might be a streetwise drug dealer, a bandit who hunts lone travelers in the wilds, a savage warrior adroit with ranged weapons, or a cyberbully among pacifists. Most thugs work for themselves, but they may employ gangs of guards to help them conduct their business.","motive":"Take what they want","environment":null,"health":9,"damage":"4 points","armor":1,"movement":"Short","modifications":[],"combat":"Thugs prefer ambushes, making ranged attacks from hiding if possible. Sometimes they spoil the ambush to issue an ultimatum before attacking: give us your valuables or you'll be sorry.\n","interactions":"Thugs are interested in money and power, which means they almost always accept bribes. If faced with a real threat, thugs usually retreat.","uses":"Thugs are everywhere, sometimes accompanied by guards who are equally malicious but not quite as powerful.","loot":"A thug has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item in addition to weapons, shields, and light armor. One thug in a group might have a cypher.","intrusions":"Another thug, hidden until just the right moment, appears and takes a shot with a ranged weapon before joining the fray."},{"name":"WIZARD, MIGHTY","kind":"NPC","level":8,"description":"Some wizards learn so many spells and accumulate so much lore that they become incredibly powerful.

Targets that are within immediate range of the wizard when they take damage are thrown out of immediate range.\nA mighty wizard knows many spells, including spells that grant +5 to Armor for an hour, spells of teleportation, spells of finding, and so on. A wizard also likely carries several cyphers useful in combat.\n","interactions":"Care should be taken when negotiating with wizards because they are subtle and quick to anger. Even when negotiations succeed, a wizard's suggestions are usually cryptic and open to interpretation. A mighty wizard might be convinced to teach a character how to cast a spell.","uses":"A wizard is putting together a team to challenge a great foe, and the PCs fit the bill.","loot":"A mighty wizard has 1d6 cyphers.","intrusions":"The wizard casts two spells as a single action instead of just one."}]}
