Others are more subtle or more obvious in their differences-a shadow of a knife-edge in their face and a touch that withers normal plants, a little too much fire in their eyes and a scent of ash in the air, a forked tongue, goatlike legs, or the inability to cast a shadow.

The bearer can cast the spell on the page as if it were a cypher with a level equal to the book's level. This doesn't remove the spell from the page (it can be cast again and again), but it does require a depletion roll.

Putting all or part of a living thing into a boundless bag is always risky, as more than one person has had their hand or head turned to gold (which might sound lovely, but typically isn't). Also, doing so often causes the boundless bag to revert to a normal bag. Items that create wealth in any fashion are particularly sought after.

A benchmark for setting an omni orb's limits is to compare it to a cypher of the orb's level-if there is a cypher that can do what the PC wants, and that cypher is equal to or less than the orb's level, it works. For example, if a team of superheroes tries to use a level 5 orb to teleport to their base 100 miles away, the GM can look at the list of cyphers and see that a teleporter (traveler) cypher can transport one character up to 100 miles per cypher level, so transporting a group of PCs 100 miles is probably within the orb's power.","options":[]},{"name":"PACK OF STORAGE","tags":["FANTASY"],"level_dice":"1d6","level_mod":1,"form":"Leather backpack or haversack with multiple pockets","depletion":"1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack; on depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack)","effect":"This pack's mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2 m) in diameter.

Their very nature and essence are evil and anti-life, even as they revel in their own endless existence. Most vampires are vain, arrogant, sadistic, lustful, and domineering. Their powers allow them to manipulate others, and they frequently toy with their prey before feeding. Vampires come out only at night, as the sun's rays will destroy them.\nThe bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of its own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the thrall of the one that killed it.

They have impressive fangs, but these are usually used in feeding, not in battle. They typically fight with their fists or hands (which basically become claws) but sometimes use weapons.\nA vampire can change into a bat or a wolf. This transformation does not change its stats or abilities except that, as a bat, it can fly. Vampires can also transform into shadow or mist, and in these forms they can't be harmed by anything (but also can't affect the physical world).\nVampires possess an unholy charisma and can mesmerize victims within immediate distance so that they stand motionless for one round. In subsequent rounds, the victim will not forcibly resist the vampire, and the vampire can suggest actions to the victim (even actions that will cause the victim to harm themselves or others they care about). Each round, the victim can attempt a new Intellect defense roll to break free.\nVampires are notoriously difficult to hurt. Unless a weapon is very special (blessed by a saint, has specific magical enchantments against vampires, or the like), no physical attack harms a vampire. They simply don't take the damage. Exceptions include the following:\nFire: Vampires burn, though the damage doesn't kill them. It only causes pain, and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within a day.\nRunning water: Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain all health lost in this way.\nHoly water: This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire exactly like fire.\nSunlight: Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within a day.\nWooden stake: This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively destroying the vampire in one blow. However, if the vampire is aware and able to move, this attack is hindered as the vampire does everything it can to evade.\nFurther, vampires have the following special weaknesses: \nGarlic: Significant amounts of garlic within immediate distance hinder a vampire's tasks.\nCross, holy symbol, or mirror: Presenting any of these objects forcefully stuns a vampire, causing it to lose its next action. While the object is brandished and the vampire is within immediate range, its tasks are hindered by two steps.\nEventually, a vampire with a multitude under its command becomes the new vampire lord.

The familiar could be a large black cat, an owl, a big snake, or some other creature.

Once a character sees through the glamour, they cannot unsee it.\nHeal: The witch touches another creature and heals them for 6 points of damage. Some witches must pull health from another living being in long range in order to use this ability. Pulling health from a living being inflicts 2 points of damage on that being.\nImprison: The witch creates a prison within long range and captures a foe inside it as a single action. The prison might be physical (a tower, a cage, a trap, a binding around the body) or mental (they can't move, their muscles are no longer under their control, they are afraid to move). Resisting being caught is a level 5 defense task (Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the type of imprisonment).

Those who attempt to pass through the spell but fail take 3 points of Intellect damage and are knocked back. Once the spell activates, it disappears.\nRevive: This rare and costly ability allows a witch to bring someone back to life, as long as they haven't been dead for more than a year. In order to accomplish this, the witch needs all or part of the body of the dead, a beloved object of the dead's, and the willingness of someone else to take on a curse that results from the magical working (roll on the Curse table to determine the resulting curse).
