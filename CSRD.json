Your awareness might make you an exception, or there may be many like you, depending on the setting. Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or another. This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also be a liquid computer, a quantum computer, or a network of smart dust particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have been an organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine. Your body, of course, is also a machine.

You're well versed in all manner of academia or other intellectual pursuits, but nothing physical. You're not weak or feeble, necessarily (although this is a good descriptor for characters who are elderly), but you have no experience in more physical activities.\r\n(Calm is a great descriptor for characters who never intended to have adventures but were thrust into them, a trope that occurs often in modern games and particularly in horror games.)","characteristics":[{"name":"Bookish","description":"+2 to your Intellect Pool."},{"name":"Skills","description":"You are trained in four nonphysical skills of your choice."},{"name":"Trivia","description":"You can come up with a random fact pertinent to the current situation when you wish it.

Your people have fur; large, pointed ears; sharp teeth and claws; and even tails. You are nimble, graceful, and quick. An ancient and sophisticated culture, your people have their own language, customs, and traditions developed in relative seclusion over the centuries. Neither conquerors nor conquered, the success of your society has come from the fact that you have given most others a wide berth. As a people, you almost never get involved in wars or similar matters, which has given other cultures the idea that you are aloof, unapproachable, or mysterious.

You're just going along with it for now until answers present themselves."]},{"name":"CHARMING","description":"You're a smooth talker and a charmer. Whether through seemingly supernatural means or just a way with words, you can convince others to do as you wish. Most likely, you're physically attractive or at least highly charismatic, and others enjoy listening to your voice. You probably pay attention to your appearance, keeping yourself well groomed. You make friends easily. You play up the personality facet of your Intellect stat; intelligence is not your strong suit.

You understand people, so you can fool them but are rarely fooled.

You often drop things, trip over your own feet, or knock things (or people) over. Some people get frustrated by this quality, but most find it funny and even a little charming.\r\n(Some players may not want to be defined by a \"negative\" quality like Clumsy, but in truth, even this kind of descriptor has enough advantages that it makes for capable and talented characters. What negative descriptors really do is make more interesting and complex characters that are often great fun to play.)","characteristics":[{"name":"Butterfingers","description":"-2 to your Speed Pool."},{"name":"Thick-Muscled","description":"+2 to your Might Pool."},{"name":"Inelegant","description":"You have a certain lovable charm. You are trained in all pleasant social interactions when you express a lighthearted, self-deprecating manner."},{"name":"Dumb Luck","description":"The GM can introduce a GM intrusion on you, based on your clumsiness, without awarding you any XP (as if you had rolled a 1 on a d20 roll). However, if this happens, 50% of the time, your clumsiness works to your advantage. Rather than hurting you (much), it helps you, or it hurts your enemies. You slip, but it's just in time to duck an attack. You fall down, but you trip your enemies as you crash into their legs. You turn around too quickly, but you end up knocking the weapon from your foe's hand. You and the GM should work together to determine the details. If the GM wishes, they can use GM intrusions based on your clumsiness normally (awarding XP)."},{"name":"Skill","description":"You've got a certain bull-like quality.

You lack the willpower and resolve to stand fast in the face of danger. Fear gnaws at your heart, chewing away at your mind, driving you to distraction until you cannot bear it. Most times, you back down from confrontations. You flee from threats and vacillate when faced with difficult decisions.\r\nYet for all that fear dogs you and possibly shames you, your cowardly nature proves to be a useful ally from time to time. Listening to your fears has helped you escape danger and avoid taking unnecessary risks. Others may have suffered in your place, and you might be the first to admit this fact, but secretly you feel intense relief from having avoided an unthinkable and terrible fate.\r\n(Descriptors like Craven, Cruel, and Dishonorable might not be appropriate for every group. These are villainous traits and some people want their PCs to be entirely heroic. But others don't mind a little moral greyness thrown into the mix.

When another endures hardship, you find it hard to care, and you may even enjoy the pain and difficulty the person experiences if they've done you wrong in the past. Your cruel streak may derive from bitterness brought about by your own struggles and disappointments. You might be a hard pragmatist, doing what you feel you must even if others are worse for it. Or you could be a sadist, delighting in the pain you inflict.\r\nBeing cruel does not necessarily make you a villain. Your cruelty may be reserved for those who cross you or other people useful to you. You might have become cruel as the result of an intensely awful experience. Abuse and torture, for example, can strip away compassion for other living beings.\r\nAs well, you need not be cruel in every situation.

Each set of facing pages includes the magical runes for one spell and a description of the spell and how to use it. When a character first opens the book, the GM randomly determines what type of spell is shown by rolling on the following table, then rolling on the indicated table in the Cypher System Reference Document. The bearer can cast the spell on the page as if it were a cypher with a level equal to the book's level.

The reader can automatically cast the spell as an action, one time only. More insidiously, if successful, the spell confers pleasure to the caster and fully restores all of their Pools. The caster must make an immediate Intellect defense roll or be compelled to use the book (and thus a new spell) again the next day.

The change takes a full day to take effect, during which time the item cannot leave the bag and the bag should not be opened. If the bag is opened, the process is canceled and must be started over. Putting all or part of a living thing into a boundless bag is always risky, as more than one person has had their hand or head turned to gold (which might sound lovely, but typically isn't). Also, doing so often causes the boundless bag to revert to a normal bag. Items that create wealth in any fashion are particularly sought after.

It eases by three steps any task related to magical lore. Even someone unskilled at magic can open it to a random page and read the spell there (the GM randomly determines the spell by rolling on the Fantastic Cypher table), which takes effect at level 10. The Darkest Book is somewhat sentient and can hide its words from anyone it doesn't want reading it. It might require a person casting a spell from it to succeed at a difficulty 6 Intellect defense roll or take 6 points of Intellect damage and move one step down the damage track.The book is technically indestructible; anything strong enough to destroy an object of its level merely destroys one of its pages, and the book can't be destroyed as long as at least one page remains.","options":[]},{"name":"DEATH RAY","tags":["SCIENCE FICTION"],"level_dice":"1d6","level_mod":3,"form":"Pistol-like device of unknown material","depletion":"1 in 1d20","effect":"This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources.","options":[]},{"name":"DEATH'S SCYTHE","tags":["FANTASY"],"level_dice":"1d6","level_mod":4,"form":"Double-handed scythe","depletion":"1 in 1d20 (check per killing effect; upon depletion, a manifestation of Death appears to reclaim its blade)","effect":"This scythe functions as a heavy weapon.

The sword eases all attacks made with it by one step, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (for a total of 8 points). If the wielder kills a creature with the sword, the sword eats the creature's spirit and transfers some of its energy to the wielder, adding 5 points to their Might Pool and increasing their Might Edge by 1.

If she agrees to help the characters in some way, it's absolutely because she has a higher goal in mind.\nUse: The characters are stopped by a beautiful woman in the woods, who asks them to help her accomplish a great task. A powerful foe has brought Morgan le Fay into his confidence, and she is helping him against the PCs.\n\nOz, The Great and Terrible 5 (15)\nIt is perhaps the greatest feat the Wizard of Oz ever pulled off to make everyone believe that he was not a sorcerer at all, but merely a ventriloquist and balloonist from some faraway land.

Sometimes faeries wield tiny weapons, such as bows, spears, or swords; treat these as light weapons.\nA faerie can see in the dark, but it can also emit bright light (often colored) and appear as a glowing humanoid or an illuminated sphere.\nFaeries regain 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0 unless they've been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon.\nIn addition to inflicting damage with their fairy dust and their weapons of choice, faeries have a number of curses and abilities at their disposal. These include the following:\nAnimal Friend: Most faeries can communicate with animals, and a few can even summon animals within long range for help and protection. Some faeries can also grant others the ability to communicate with animals, but only for a day.\nCharm: Some faeries can attempt to use a song or light display to charm others within short range. The target must succeed on an Intellect defense task or fall into a suggestible state for one hour. During this period, the target can be led by the faerie until attacked, damaged, or shaken from their glamour.\nClairvoyance: The faerie grants someone the ability to see the future, the past, faeries, or one of the hidden faerie worlds. This gift lasts for one day, or until the character makes a ten-hour recovery roll.\nHeal: The faerie heals themselves, a plant, a creature, or another character for 1d6 + 2 points of damage.\nIllusion: Powerful faeries can cast elaborate and convincing illusions that make them and their worlds appear more appealing and beautiful. Illusions can cover up to a mile in area. Seeing through the illusion is a task equal to the faerie's level and lasts for ten minutes. After that, the viewer reverts to seeing the illusion and quickly forgets that they saw anything else.\nInvisibility: Makes the faerie invisible to most eyes. Seeing, hearing, or sensing a faerie when it's invisible is a task equal to the faerie's level. A failed attempt to see a faerie causes the viewer to see something that harms their mind, inflicting 1 point of Intellect damage.\nVortex: A defensive tactic where one or more threatened faeries use their wings to create a strong gust of wind, tornado, or vortex. The wind pushes their foes back a long distance and inflicts 2 points of damage.\nFaeries have a wide variety of weaknesses, including silver, iron, technology, sugar and salt (they must count each grain), and cream (intoxicates them).

Vampires come out only at night, as the sun's rays will destroy them.\nThe bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of its own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the thrall of the one that killed it.

Vampires can also transform into shadow or mist, and in these forms they can't be harmed by anything (but also can't affect the physical world).\nVampires possess an unholy charisma and can mesmerize victims within immediate distance so that they stand motionless for one round.

Unless a weapon is very special (blessed by a saint, has specific magical enchantments against vampires, or the like), no physical attack harms a vampire. They simply don't take the damage. Exceptions include the following:\nFire: Vampires burn, though the damage doesn't kill them. It only causes pain, and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within a day.\nRunning water: Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain all health lost in this way.\nHoly water: This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire exactly like fire.\nSunlight: Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within a day.\nWooden stake: This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively destroying the vampire in one blow. However, if the vampire is aware and able to move, this attack is hindered as the vampire does everything it can to evade.\nFurther, vampires have the following special weaknesses: \nGarlic: Significant amounts of garlic within immediate distance hinder a vampire's tasks.\nCross, holy symbol, or mirror: Presenting any of these objects forcefully stuns a vampire, causing it to lose its next action.

The familiar could be a large black cat, an owl, a big snake, or some other creature.

A failed attempt inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Once a character sees through the glamour, they cannot unsee it.\nHeal: The witch touches another creature and heals them for 6 points of damage. Some witches must pull health from another living being in long range in order to use this ability. Pulling health from a living being inflicts 2 points of damage on that being.\nImprison: The witch creates a prison within long range and captures a foe inside it as a single action. The prison might be physical (a tower, a cage, a trap, a binding around the body) or mental (they can't move, their muscles are no longer under their control, they are afraid to move). Resisting being caught is a level 5 defense task (Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the type of imprisonment).

Those who attempt to pass through the spell but fail take 3 points of Intellect damage and are knocked back. Once the spell activates, it disappears.\nRevive: This rare and costly ability allows a witch to bring someone back to life, as long as they haven't been dead for more than a year. In order to accomplish this, the witch needs all or part of the body of the dead, a beloved object of the dead's, and the willingness of someone else to take on a curse that results from the magical working (roll on the Curse table to determine the resulting curse). Revive takes ten minutes to cast, and the character returns to life with 1 point in all of their Pools.\nSeduce: Creatures within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll become enamored of the witch.
